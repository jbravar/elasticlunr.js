A school cannot instil, instruct or infuse self-confidence, but it can provide an environment that fosters the development of self-confidence. This is where Albert College excels. \n\n\nParents from around the world have told me how amazed they have been by the transformations they have seen in their children. When children are away at boarding school for months at a stretch, there is a perfect opportunity to assess the changes that take place over their years at Albert College.\n\n\nHow is this accomplished? The supportive, family environment combined with our expectation that every student participate in the 5 'A’s, means that students are stretched beyond their comfort zone while knowing they have the support and backing of caring faculty and peers. Students have to challenge themselves in areas that are new to them. Whether it is playing a new sport, singing a solo in vocal class, preparing and presenting a public speaking piece or participating in a Duke of Edinburgh canoe trip, students discover strengths and talents they never knew they had. As their range of experiences broadens, students cannot help becoming more confident in their ability to approach each new challenge. \n\nOur students also develop self-confidence through incremental opportunities for leadership. By the time our students reach Grade 12, all have had opportunities for involvement in a wide variety of committees and service activities. In particular, groups of students participate in international service trips, in leadership roles in local service organizations such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters and each year the entire school community votes for a group of Prefects who take on major leadership roles within the school.\n\n\nThe growth I see in these student leaders each year is remarkable. Albert College does not teach self-confidence, but one look at our graduates tells you that Albert College provides a perfect environment for our students to discover the potential within themselves.\n\n\nKeith Stansfield, Head of School","dirAdmissions":"Heather Kidd","phone":"613-968-5726","admissionsPhone":"613-968-5726","fax":"613-968-9651","email":"info@albertcollege.ca","academicSummary":"In spite of its small size, Albert College offers a diverse academic program. The curriculum exceeds the standards set by the Ontario curriculum and is delivered by passionate, qualified teachers many of whom hold specialist qualifications and Master's degrees. Through extensive counselling and unique course offerings, we strive to develop an academic program suited to each student, one that will enable students to achieve their post-secondary goal.\n\nAdvisor System\nEarly in the year each student is assigned an academic advisor from among the faculty. This faculty member acts as the primary contact person for parents. While parents are free to contact any faculty member if they have a concern or question, the advisor can best collect information from all areas that affect the students' school life and share this with the parents. In addition to regular weekly meetings, advisors will meet with their advisees when one-on-one counselling is required. The academic advisor distributes effort grades and mark updates to students and parents, discusses them and recommends remedial action. Reporting of marks and effort grades occurs regularly throughout the school year.","dirAcademics":"Assistant Head - Academics Dianne Purdie","campusLifeSummary":"Albert College lies on 25 acres in beautiful Belleville, Ontario, Canada. There are two main buildings located on campus, the Junior School and the Middle/Senior School. The Senior School building also includes the junior and senior boys’ residences, Baker House and Graham Hall as well as the girls’ residence, Victoria Manor. The Senior School is a historic gothic style building that was built in 1923. There are plenty of large trees and outdoor areas to relax, read, study or play games. For those who like to walk, jog, or bike, a large waterfront park is located just minutes from the College on the beautiful Bay of Quinte.\n\nSenior School Facilities\n\nAlbert College offers its Senior School students many different resources and modern facilities including: Midi Music, MAC and PC Computer Labs; a resource center and library with 14,000 volumes; wireless internet access in all classrooms and residences; classrooms are equipped with Smart Boards™; an indoor swimming pool, two squash courts, full service gymnasium and a fitness room; outdoor tennis courts, sports fields; an outdoor quad with picnic tables; and a common room lounge with pool table, comfy couches and a big screen television.\n\nAlbert College continues to embrace technology.

Smart classrooms are equipped with video projectors and other peripheral devices.\n\nMemorial Chapel\n\nAlbert's Memorial Chapel is located at the centre of the school. Faculty, residential staff and students begin their day here with an assembly. On certain days, this 15-minute gathering will include announcements relating to school events and features prefect thematic presentations.\n\nEach Wednesday morning, there is a more formal Chapel Service of approximately 30 minutes. Although the heritage of our chapel worship is Christian in nature, great care is taken to honour all religious traditions. Guest speakers and faculty share knowledge of these traditions with the entire school community in the chapel setting. These Wednesday services also include presentations that raise awareness about important global issues.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Girls Residence Heather Kidd","studentLifeSummary":"Albert College has been called home by many generations of students, both boarding and day.

Flat seniors assist residential staff in numerous activities, from social events to study hall sign-ins. Day and residential prefects, members of a team of graduate students elected by the school, also provide leadership and support to the student body.\n \nThe residential teams are also available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week to provide support, friendship, and guidance. At Albert College, students will learn about other cultures and make lifelong friends while also learning a great deal about themselves as individuals.

Currently, there are 13 URJ camps throughout North America that serve more than 8000 campers each summer.","dirSummer":"","summerPrograms":[],"meritDescription":"","gallery":[{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo1.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo1.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Lake View"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo2.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo2.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo3.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo3.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo4.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo4.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo5.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo5.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo6.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo6.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo7.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo7.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo8.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/884/images/Photo8.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""}],"events":[{"name":"Prospective Student Weekend","type":"Feature Event","start":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2015-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","location":"American Hebrew Academy","description":"The American Hebrew Academy (AHA), was established to provide an outstanding coeducational college preparatory program and Jewish secondary education. It is our goal to intellectually motivate academically able students who are prepared to engage in the rigorous discipline of the dual curriculum. The Academy seeks to educate the whole student – mind, body and soul. \n\nFounded in 2000 on 100 acres in Greensboro, North Carolina, the American Hebrew Academy is the only international Jewish residential secondary school. The Academy provides a nurturing educational environment where students are challenged to prepare for college, explore their Jewish identity, and graduate with lifelong skills for learning and leadership. \n\nThe American Hebrew Academy uses a comprehensive pedagogical strategy of examining, discussing, and expanding topics in a small classroom environment, and a program of challenging, immersive experiences to equip young adults with independent reasoning skills, strength of character, and a well-developed sense of Jewish identity. Students graduate with confidence to continue their personal growth, engage with their communities, and inspire others. Thirty-two percent of the faculty hold a Ph.D., Ed.D. or J.D.\n\nThe Academy's 137 students and 45 faculty members represent diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Thirty percent of the student body is international. The student to faculty ratio is 3:1 with an average class size of 12 students.","link":""}],"news":[]},{"id":1100,"name":"Appleby College","address":{"full":"540 Lakeshore Road West Oakville, Ontario L6K3P1 Canada","base":"540 Lakeshore Road West","zip":"L6K3P1","city":"Oakville","state":"Ontario","country":"Canada","region":"Eastern Canada"},"addressString":"540 Lakeshore Road West Oakville, Ontario L6K3P1 Canada","location":{"lat":43.4261098,"lng":-79.68592319999999},"applicationType":[],"studentType":"COED","schoolType":["SECONDARY"],"religion":"Anglican","artsPrograms":["Art Club","Audiovisual Club","Brass Ensemble","Chamber Choir","Chamber Ensemble","Chamber Orchestra","Choral Music","Dance","Drama Club","Guitar Ensemble","Jazz Ensemble","Rock Band","Stage Band","String Ensemble","Tech Crew","Theater"],"recreationalSports":["Aerobics","Badminton","Baseball","Basketball","Canoeing","Cross Country Running","Dance","Golf","Hiking","Ice Hockey","Outdoor Education","Rock Climbing","Soccer","Squash","Swimming","Table Tennis","Tennis","Track and Field","Volleyball","Weight Lifting"],"interscholasticSports":["Badminton","Baseball","Basketball","Cross Country Running","Dance","Field Hockey","Golf","Ice Hockey","Rugby","Soccer","Softball","Squash","Swimming","Tennis","Track and Field","Volleyball"],"clubs":["Chess Club","Community Service","Computer Club","Debate Club","Diversity Club","Dorm Proctors","Drama Club","Environmental Club","Food Council","International Club","Math Club","Model UN","Newspaper","Peer Counseling","Peer Tutoring","Photography","Student Activities","Student Government","Student Publications","Theater","Yearbook"],"facilities":["Basketball Court","Fitness Center","Technology Center","Volleyball Court","Sand Volleyball Court","Indoor Basketball Court","Racquetball Court","Indoor Pool","Indoor Climbing Wall"],"dormAmenities":["Dorm Game Room","Dorm Laundry","Dorm Lounge","Dorm Wifi"],"musicPrograms":["Band","Choral Music","Composition","Electronic Music","History of Jazz","History of Music","Music Individual Instructions","Music Appreciation","Music History","Music Theory","Opera","Orchestera","Principles of Arranging","Recording","Songwriting","Voice"],"apPrograms":["AP Art History","AP Biology","AP Calculus AB","AP Calculus CD","AP Chemistry","AP Computer Science A","AP Computer Science AB","AP Macroeconomics","AP English Language","AP English Literature","AP French","AP German","AP Human Geography","AP Physics B","AP Physics C","AP Psychology","AP Spanish","AP Statistics","AP Studio Art","AP US History","AP World History"],"computerPrograms":["Computer Science"],"religiousPrograms":["Moral Philosophy","World Religions"],"mathPrograms":["Algebra","Calculus","Functions","Statistics"],"foreignPrograms":["Mandarin Chinese","French","German","Spanish"],"specialPrograms":["Community Service","Exchange Programs","Leadership","Outdoor Education","Study Abroad"],"sciencePrograms":["Biology","Chemistry","Earth Science","Geology","Health Science","Microbiology","Physical Science","Physics","Sports Medicine"],"historyPrograms":["World History"],"visualPrograms":["3D Design","Acting","Animation","Architecture","Art","Art History","Ballet","Ceramics","Choreography","Dance","Debate","Design","Directing","Drama","Drawing","Film and Video","Graphic Design","History of Theater","Journalism","Lighting Design","Modern Dance","Painting","Photography","Portfolio","Pottery","Printmaking","Production","Public Speaking","Publications","Screenwriting","Sculpture","Stagecraft","Studio Art","Theater Arts","Theater Design"],"socialPrograms":["Economics"],"advancedPrograms":["AP Courses"],"englishPrograms":["English Classics","Creative Writing","English Literature","Playwriting","Poetry"],"supportPrograms":["College Counseling","Evening Study Assistance","Learning Center","Peer Tutoring","Study Skills Assistance","Subject Tutoring","Technology Center"],"applicationTypeString":[],"saturdayTypeString":"NONE","schoolTypeString":["high school"],"studentTypeString":"coed","schedule":"OTHER","summer":true,"dress":"UNIFORM","paymentPlan":true,"finAid":true,"scholarship":true,"applicationDeadline":"ROLLING","grades":"9 -

Week\n\nAsheville School wants to help teenagers learn how to make apps this summer. The co-ed boarding and day school is offering a distinctive day camp in July that focuses on teaching kids how to write code, think critically, and make apps using Apple’s programming language – Swift.\n\nLed by two experienced app developers, Technology Director Charles Long and Communications Director Bob Williams, Asheville School’s Summer App Development Camp will teach young people ages 13 to 18 all about how to code apps.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for any student who’s ever dreamed of making their own app to learn the process behind creating an app from scratch,” said Williams, who worked with Long to create Asheville School’s award-winning iPhone and iPad app.  “In 2015, during our inaugural year, we only had room for 15 students. This year, we decided to expand the camp to two weeks, hoping to teach up to 50 teenagers how to make apps like Instagram, Crossy Road and Geometry Dash.”\n\nTeens may enroll in one or two weeks. Week One begins Monday, July 17 - Friday, July 21 and Week Two begins Monday, July 24 – Friday, July 28. The daily schedule each week is from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with lunch provided each day in the School’s dining hall. Those who register by June 1 will also receive an app development book and app camp T-shirt.\n\n“This camp is one of the few app camps in the country that will truly teach kids the basics of computer programming and expose them to Apple’s iOS Development Kit,” Long said. “We’d love to one day look back and say we helped the next Steve Jobs, Marissa Mayer, or Bill Gates get started writing code.”","link":"http://www.ashevilleschool.org/appdevcamp"}],"news":[{"title":"Alumnus Patrick Darab ‘05 Sings with Glee","date":"2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Asheville School alumnus Patrick Darab 2005 (Hickory, NC) is in several spotlights.

From Arts to athletics, we provide opportunities for each of our students to get involved in an activity they love or to be a risk taker and try something new.\n\n-Leadership-\n\nBalmoral Hall School offers many leadership opportunities for the students in Senior School, Middle School and Junior School. Prefects are an integral part of the daily operation of Balmoral Hall.\n\n-Service Learning-\n\nReaching out to our global community through service is a very important part of student life at Balmoral Hall School. Service learning trips provide authentic learning experiences and allow students to take learning beyond the classroom.\n\n-Interhouse-\n\nAt BH, the entire school – staff and students are divided into four groups called Houses. Houses compete against each other during the year in athletics, debating, and various spirited competitions. The four Houses, Glen Gairn, Craig Gowan, Ballater and Braemar were derived from places surrounding Balmoral Castle (which is where our school gets its name.)\n\n-Debate and Public Speaking- \n\nIn the debate and public speaking program the students focus on the development of their speaking, listening and analytic skills.  and their ability to exhibit the qualities of a critical thinker.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Student Activities Mandy Green","studentLifeSummary":"There is never a dull moment in student life at Balmoral Hall School.

ARTS - Do you love to dance, sing or act? Do you love to create with your hands, a paintbrush or computer? Whether you want to be on the stage or behind the scenes; publicly praised or quietly applauded, we believe in helping you to develop your talent and perfect your skill.\n\nEven if you elect to pursue AP Sciences but love the Arts, you'll have the opportunity to experience it all. At BH we do not expect you to narrow your choices—we want you to expand your vision.

But here's an overview: Since 1893, Baylor has been one the south's premier college-preparatory schools. Our beautiful 690-acre campus is located on the Tennessee River and only five minutes from downtown Chattanooga. Students enjoy the benefits that come from small classes, a unique leadership program and innovative curriculum, an exceptional faculty, vast extracurricular choices, and nationally recognized athletic teams. Graduates are admitted to colleges and universities nationwide, including Ivy League schools (the most recent class was offered more than $14 million in scholarships).","dirAdmissions":"Jim Kennedy","phone":"423-267-8505","admissionsPhone":"423-267-5902","fax":"423-757-2525","email":"admission@baylorschool.org","academicSummary":"The teaching faculty consist of 80 men and 52 women holding 79 advanced degrees, including 16 doctorates and 3 JDs. As part of Baylor's important advisery program, teachers also serve as advisers, regularly interacting closely with students in all aspects of their school life.","dirAcademics":"Upper School Head Shaw Wilson","campusLifeSummary":"The beauty of Baylor's campus, outstanding facilities, an extensive extracurricular program, and a network of involved and caring dorm faculty create a vibrant boarding community. To keep the experience from being overwhelming, the Baylor support network is vast. Dorm parents work with students on a nightly basis to help them establish and refine study skills that will help them succeed in the classroom. Advisers work with students to set goals and to make thoughtful and appropriate choices. Dorm heads allow students the opportunities to make decisions, solve problems and to try their hand in leadership roles. Each student, faculty member, administrator, and boarding parent has a Baylor email address, providing easy access to instant connections.  Across campus, Baylor boarding students are recognized for the depth of interest and sense of self-reliance. Throughout the year we host boarding Open House events for prospective families and each summer we offer boarding camps -- two great ways to see for yourself what it's like to live and learn at Baylor!","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Residential Life Garrison Conner","studentLifeSummary":"When the academic day at Baylor ends, another type of discovery takes place. We believe the benefits of extracurricular activities and competitive athletics are fundamental to a person's total education. That's why we require all students to participate in either a sport or an afternoon activity (community service, organic gardening, drama, outdoor enrichment, etc.)each day. \nIn addition, we provide a huge number of clubs and organizations. From the Swing Dance Club to the Science Club, there are certainly ample opportunities to try it all. Students also have the opportunity to join their classmates in a variety of extracurricular opportunities and fun outings around campus and the Chattanooga area. For our boarding students, this is especially important. Baylor's Student Activities Director and the Student Activities Team, as well as the Walkabout office, plan off-campus excursions every weekend. Each outing is chaperoned by at least one faculty member, which provides yet another chance for students to build relationships with adults outside the classroom.","artsAthleticsSummary":"In addition to offering courses at each grade level in visual and performing arts, our calendar is packed each year with performances, concerts, exhibits, and special trips. We are also fortunate to welcome to campus throughout the year authors, choreographers, dancers, musicians, poets, and artists from all disciplines as visiting artists and guest lecturers.\n\n\nBaylor's athletic program is legendary.  We offer 17 sports and 72 teams in grades 6-12 and Sports Illustrated recognized our athletic program among the \"top 25\" in the U.S.\n\nBaylor teams have won more than 145 state titles in the last 20 years.\n\nWe also offer a wide variety of boarding sports clinics in the summer.","dirArts":"Art Department Chair Beth Gumick","dirAthletics":"Athletics Director Lepcio","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Baylor's College Counseling Office is in the business of enabling students to see a perfect fit, and then assisting them in making that match with colleges throughout the application process. \n\nWe know each student has a different story to tell and that each will enter the college search process in his or her own way and in his or her own time.

Nestled in the heart of Historic Deerfield, Bement offers a unique experience for our forty boarding students. The small size of our boarding community means that each of the four ten-person dormitories feels like a real home. The dorms are centered around common rooms with features including fireplaces, tables with space to spread out and play cards or board games, kitchenettes, and plenty of couches and chairs so that the entire dorm can relax together. Family-style meals in our dining hall provide an opportunity for students to dine with a diverse group of peers and dorm parents. Boarders often pitch in to help take care of our campus: they help our kitchen staff set up for meals and clean up afterward, shovel snow during our New England winters, and are responsible for daily and weekly chores in the dorm, including doing dishes, taking out the trash and recycling, and vacuuming. Bement boarders build close relationships with many of the adults in our community. With just ten students per dorm, the two dorm parents who lead each dorm get to know each boarder well. Just like the members of a family, Bement students and adults work together to live and learn successfully.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Boarding David Belcher","studentLifeSummary":"Our weekdays in the dorm are busy and full. Each day begins with the entire boarding community gathering for breakfast in the dining hall. Then, it’s off to a full day of classes, followed by sports practices or games. After an hour of downtime in the dorm, it’s time for dinner and study hall. Evenings in the dorm are a time to call, email, or Skype home, make a snack, get homework help from a dorm parent, and prepare for the next day.\n\nOn weekends, we take full advantage of all that our beautiful campus, the Pioneer Valley, and New England have to offer. Weekends are full of a variety of activities. Some of these are trips to other places, like visits to local fairs and festivals, malls, movie theaters, and museums like Mass MoCA and the Norman Rockwell Museum. We also enjoy excursions to local hotspots like Northampton and Shelburne Falls, and special, longer trips to Boston and New York City. Other activities are closer to home, like swimming at our head of school’s house, competitive rounds of bingo in our dining hall, bike rides on Old Main Street, hikes up the nearby Pocumtuck Ridge, sports games, and craft workshops on campus.

As a College Preparatory school, BHS provides students with guidance about the journey toward Higher Education including aspects such as Course Selection and Strength, Co-curricular Activities, Community Service, Leadership, Test Preparation, College Search, College Application, and Financial Aid. Students are informed of their many college options and are supported as they develop the tools necessary to research, apply, and effectively transition to college. As more and more colleges move toward test optional policies and a holistic admissions review process, we encourage well roundedness and personal development in our students, in addition to academic excellence and successful standardized testing.\n\nBHS does not view college admission as \"a prize to be won\". It is the result of thoughtful research, preparation and planning. Hence, the college counseling process is an individualized one, the goal of which is the best possible match between each of our unique students and the college or university which best meets that student's needs. Our students matriculate to a wide range of institutions, from public universities to small art colleges. Approximately 90% of seniors choose to enroll at four-year institutions, while the remaining 10% may opt to defer admission while taking a gap year, or to enroll in a two-year school with the plan to transfer to a four-year degree program in the near future.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Abby Croft","colleges":[{"name":"University of California,  Santa Cruz","attending":4},{"name":"Evergreen State College","attending":4},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","attending":2},{"name":"California Polytechnic State University","attending":2},{"name":"School of the Arts Institute of Chicago","attending":2},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":2},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":1}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"English Language and American Culture: Students will embark on an immersion journey in speaking English, getting to know the BHS campus, and exploring Ojai and California.

Expert faculty members teach our classes to exacting standards, yet, at the same time, they truly know—and care about—our  students as scholars, leaders, athletes, artists, friends and individuals. This knowledge fosters personalized learning opportunities and leads to higher academic achievement, as students are continually challenged to reach their full potential.\n\nAt Blair, two faculty members mentor each student as he or she explores passions and interests in and out of the classroom. Our “open architecture” curriculum offers core courses and innovative electives, including 52 honors, Advanced Placement and post-AP classes. The School has a robust athletics program with 28 varsity and 19 JV and thirds teams in traditional high school sports, as well as golf, skiing, squash and crew. In addition, Blair boasts a fine and performing arts program featuring art exhibits and theatrical productions, several musical ensembles, and eclectic courses in artistic disciplines. \n\nForward-thinking leadership education and meaningful service initiatives help to prepare our students for success in an increasingly complex world.

The result is a supportive environment where lifelong friendships are forged.\n\nRegardless of whether students are boarders or day students, our residential life program encourages them to broaden their horizons and explore new interests. Blair’s campus offers an incredible wealth of opportunities for engagement: Students can write essays or articles for The Oracle or host its Internet radio station, perform community service on campus or at a range of area nonprofits, run for student government or compete as part of the debate team.\n\nNo matter what your interests, you will find your niche at Blair.

We believe that a challenging liberal arts curriculum exposes our students to a variety of perspectives on human knowledge and values. Students are encouraged to be open-minded, to ask questions and to inquire, in order to become knowledgeable. They are taught the tools to become critical thinkers, integrative thinkers and effective communicators. They are expected to demonstrate care for others and the environment, as well as principled behavior in all aspects of their lives. They are supported to achieve balance in their lives. Finally, they are provided with opportunities to take risks and to reflect on their learning.","dirAcademics":"Director of Academics Hebdon Kate","campusLifeSummary":"Our students are active partners in creating Branksome Hall's stimulating atmosphere.

Each counsellor supports the academic, social, and emotional dimensions of a student’s life at Branksome Hall. Counsellors deliver a program through classroom instruction, the teacher-advisor program, completion of the annual educational plan, career exploration activities, individual assistance and short-term counselling.

At Brentwood, student choice is a unique part of our culture and a deciding factor in who attends the School. It’s why this place is so special. We believe when students truly choose to be here, and they’re surrounded by a family of like-minded friends and supporters, they can be anything. This philosophy creates a warm, friendly, and passionate community of students from over 40 countries around the world who gain the independence and skills necessary to succeed in the post-secondary world.?\n\nSince 1923, we have worked diligently to establish a modern, transformative place of learning and leadership, mirroring the educational experience of a small college rather than a traditional boarding school. Prospective students are drawn to our school’s innovative tripartite approach to academics, arts, and athletics; as well as our nurturing boarding environment and strong university preparatory programs. Our unique tripartite scheduling creates unrivalled opportunities for student discovery and growth. Not only is Brentwood a remarkable place to make lifelong friends while gaining a world-class education, Brentwood truly is where students choose to be.","dirAdmissions":"Clayton Johnston","phone":"250-743-5521","admissionsPhone":"250-743-5521","fax":"250-743-2911","email":"admissions@brentwood.bc.ca","academicSummary":"As a university preparatory school, the pursuit of academic excellence is one of our school’s fundamental aims. We strive to help students reach levels of achievement that truly reflect their ability, attitude, and effort.\n\nTo create ideal learning conditions, we provide students with the required technology, small class sizes, and low student-teacher ratios. When it is advantageous, we also group students by ability. Our academic curriculum drives our prep school mandate and also meets the prescribed BC (British Columbia) provincial learning outcomes.\n\nBrentwood has a long tradition of seeking new and innovative ways to enhance learning for each individual student. Our new Personalized Enrichment Program allows qualified students to access courses outside of our regular curricula by incorporating blended learning using external educational partners.\n\nOur programs are shaped to prepare Brentwood graduates for post-secondary education and careers in a rapidly changing global workplace. We also expand our students’ academic experiences via online courses from universities such as Stanford.\n\nSkill development through problem-solving, collaborative projects, and technology integration feature strongly as pedagogical goals. Academics at our school establish a love of learning that extends well beyond our school gates.","dirAcademics":"Director of Academics Cheryl Murtland","campusLifeSummary":"Community, challenge, opportunity, and support: these are words Brentonians use to describe life at Brentwood. They also talk about making friends for life.\n\nAsk prospective students about the thought of going to class on Saturday morning: the response is likely to be negative. Ask Brentwood students about finishing academic classes by 1:15pm every day, and having afternoons free for athletics and the arts: their response is positive. Brentwood's schedule is unique and few Brentonians would change it. They like Brentwood's distinctive rhythm, a product of our tripartite program scheduling.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Head- Campus Life Marius Felix","studentLifeSummary":"Brentwood College School is a home away from home for 406 boarders and 104 local day students. Although over 30 countries are represented on campus, most Brentwood students hail from Western Canada, and the US Pacific Northwest, as well as a significant number, are expatriate Canadians whose parents are working overseas.\n\nIn this international mix, Brentonians have grown up in many cultures. From the gentle slopes of the Napa Valley to the blazing desert of the Gulf States, they come from six continents, tropical and arctic climates, and almost every time zone. While all students speak and study in English, a student's first language may be Russian or Mandarin, Spanish or Japanese, Turkish or Thai.

The students, faculty, facilities and support staff all work together for two weeks leading up to the regatta doing a huge array of tasks including: building the stages for the musical performances, preparing the sleeping areas for visitors, creating 500 extra plates per meal, readying the race course, and registering all the competitors. These same volunteers also donate 72 hrs of volunteer time during the three days of the regatta. Students enrolled in the school's business program  provide stalls on the school's plaza offering delicious food, t-shirts and other items.\n\nFor this year's 47th regatta, visiting athletes and coaches will be hosted in our new LEED dining room, a sustainable building that will be opened a few weeks prior to the regatta. Our regatta is designed to be a green event, with recycling, composting, and reusable materials encouraged. The local Scouting and Cub group and the student environmental group (BEAT) are in charge of running the 'green regatta' and ensuring proper garbage disposal. Certificates are given to the student businesses that meet the sustainability standards set for the regatta.\n\nIn the boathouse, all of our equipment will be tuned up during the two weeks prior to regatta ensuring that every shell is ready to race. The week prior to the regatta, the on-water preparation will be completed for the start dock, the safety boats, and the buoys. Students participating in the boathouse programme run the regatta from the water and are in charge of the safety boats and the start dock. These same students also spend hours of their own time training all the drivers for the umpire boats on the water showing them the proper driving techniques to follow the races with the umpires and how to navigate the school's waterfront. There are 50 boats in the Brentwood fleet, all of which will be used during the regatta.\n\nThis year a new boat will be christened at the regatta in memory of Bob Dallin, our boatman who passed away last fall.\n\nRegistration for the regatta opens on March 15th and closes on April 10th. Please see http://regatta.brentwood.bc.ca/ for more information about this major annual event.

You’ll form lasting bonds with your dorm mates as you live, learn, study, and play together. This is the time in your life where you’ll learn to become independent, be accountable for your actions, get along with others, make important life decisions, form lifelong relationships, and develop skills that will help make your transition to college a smooth one. But you won’t be alone—you’ll be surrounded by a community of caring people, ranging from your academic advisor to your community life parent to supportive peers.\n\nThrough group meetings, students create and manage their living environment. Once a week, members of each dorm gather in their lounges to discuss concerns and possible solutions, vote on decisions, and share ideas. You’ll learn how to become a leader of character and integrity, learn to work with others, effectively run meetings, consider other viewpoints, and communicate with a diverse range of people.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Campus Affairs Bret Barnett","studentLifeSummary":"Life at Brewster is not just about living in a safe, incredibly beautiful campus by a lake … in a town so friendly that the whole world comes to visit.\n\nAt the heart of Brewster’s community life is the firm belief that leaders aren’t necessarily born, they are made. And that leadership skills, visionary thinking, and character, are all qualities you develop by getting involved in a learning community founded on such principles as: respect, being helpful, contributing, and serving yourself and others with your best in all you do. \n\nSpend a few hours touring our campus. You’ll notice that regardless of whether it is within the classroom or outside—through student activities, athletics, a vibrant dorm life, community service, or decisive group meetings—these are the fundamental values that guide every aspect of life at Brewster.\n\nYou won't find a shortage of activities in which to participate at Brewster. Whatever your interests, you're sure to find a group that shares your interest and enthusiasm. Whether you're interested in the environment, a paintball enthusiast, a knitter, a dancer, or enjoy interacting with children (Brewster Big Friends), there is something for everyone. You may prefer to spend time helping others with a community service project, participating in a school leadership position, or working on a local or international project with the Interact Club.

At SEM  academics are rigorous, trust is intrinsic, and creative, independent thinking is valued. Our humanities and STEAM curricula, arts, clubs, and athletics prepare girls for their remarkable futures. \n\nAn average class size of 11 and Harkness table learning guarantees attention from dedicated faculty. Our 1:1 tablet program, STEAM, and digital literacy curricula give girls competency and inspiration to pursue science in college and career. \n\nSEM's unique urban campus maximizes the benefits of city living: parks, galleries, notable architecture, shops, and cafes are steps away.\n\nSEM's 5-day boarding is perfect for girls to have total access to clubs, sports, community service, and supervised study during the week but family time on the weekends. \n\nSEM's proximity to Toronto by car and short flight to New York City, Chicago, or Boston makes it conveniently accessed.\n\nThe late John Chubb, president of NAIS, commented after a school tour in 2014, \"I was guided by one local and one international student. I was struck by their obvious kinship and by the affection among students of all types, in classrooms, the cafeteria, the gymnasium, everywhere.

Forward thinking is our tradition.\n\nOur cozy urban campus is located in the historic and bustling Elmwood Village neighborhood. \n\nOur intimate environment allows girls to challenge themselves and to thrive. Students receive individual attention from outstanding faculty who promote a learner-centered classroom. And because average class size is 11, every student's perspective is voiced and heard. \n\nAt SEM, girls are excited to be part of a school community where trust is intrinsic and independent thinking is valued.\n\nA SEM education fosters a multicultural, global perspective. The diversity and cohesiveness of our student population was recently remarked upon by John Chubb, President of NAIS. \n\n\"I was struck by how well-prepared these girls will be for the diverse world they will soon lead.\"\n\nOur prescient 1:1 tablet program began in 2008 when STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) was an emergent educational movement. STEM has recently added an “A” for Art & Design and our program responded with a STEAM curriculum for freshman girls and electives for upperclassmen. Women are perpetually underrepresented in the STEAM fields and we aim to be part of the solution.\n\nOur successful college counseling pairs an emphasis on achievement with finding the best fit so our students can continue to flourish.\n \nWe believe in standards, but not standardization. We're not limited by New York State Regents requirements. By her junior and senior years, in addition to honors and Advanced Placement courses, a student can pursue electives that explore her interests, such as urban studies, theater, oceanography, or gothic literature. SEM students are encouraged to pursue academic work within courses or to create their own.\n\nSEM is accredited by New York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS) and National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS).

Our family-oriented barracks and campus community is nestled in a beautiful rural town, and our perfectly sized student body of about 100 boys ensures that all Carson Long cadets have the best chance to achieve success and get into their colleges of choice.There is always something to do at Carson Long Military Academy. Aside from homework and study time, cadets are enrolled in U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) and can participate in a number of school clubs and extracurricular activities.\n\nThroughout the year, Carson Long cadets are offered over 70 trips and activities that they can participate in, ranging from skiing to Nerf Parties to leadership challenge weekends, amusement parks, local festivals, movie theaters, paintball venues, and dances with girls' schools. Town passes and weekend leave are also available with permission. All activities are available to any cadet who is in good academic and disciplinary standing.","artsAthleticsSummary":"The philosophy of Carson Long's Athletic Department is that all of our team members are students first and foremost. Academics are the educational foundation for future endeavors. Academic studies provide exercise and discipline for the brain, while athletics provide exercise and discipline for the rest of the body. Athletic contests are a key component of a well-rounded education. They foster self-discipline, patriotism, teamwork, and respect for tradition. In addition to physical fitness, they offer a terrific opportunity for learning the core values of sacrifice, sincere effort, and teamwork.","dirArts":"Fine Arts Chair Tracy Klein","dirAthletics":"Fine Arts Chair Sommerville","notable":["Anfernee Brice '15 tops 1,000 pt. mark for career.","Brice wins 2nd place in PIAA D3 T&F Meet",""],"collegeSummary":"As a college preparatory military academy, Carson Long devotes extensive resources to guiding students through a personalized college counseling experience, including the college selection and application process, using the Naviance Program software. Naviance is a comprehensive college and career readiness solution for middle and high schools that helps align student strengths and interests to post-secondary goals to improve student outcomes. Carson Long's College Counselor, CDR Traci Ross, looks forward to starting the \"college process\" with students and parents as early as 6th grade. As she's told the cadets, no matter if they're in 6th grade or 12th grade, it's never too early or too late to start planning for college. Through individual and family meetings, we will create a unique plan to help guide each cadet through the college search process with the ultimate goal of finding the best fit for all.","dirCollege":"College Counselor Traci Ross","colleges":[{"name":"St John's","attending":5},{"name":"Virginia Tech","attending":3},{"name":"Penn State (main)","attending":2},{"name":"John Jay College","attending":3},{"name":"The Citadel","attending":1}],"alumni":[],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"The 2016 Carson Long Summer Leadership Experience is a two-week camp based at Carson Long.

Residential life is structured to develop well-being and leadership through the practice of self-discipline and service. In addition to an inquiry-driven curriculum designed to elicit the greatest possible growth in every student, all students participate in an extracurricular program that includes athletics, drama, music, dance, community service, and an extensive outdoor program. With more than 50 honors and advanced courses, the Cate curriculum can meet the demands of the most ambitious students. A typical applicant to Cate has impeccable character, a history of high academic achievement, and is mature, curious, adventurous, and willing to assume responsibility and independence.","dirAdmissions":"Charlotte Brownlee '85","phone":"805-684-4127","admissionsPhone":"805-684-4127 ext.217","fax":"805-684-2279","email":"admission@cate.org","academicSummary":"Any school—including Cate—can offer you a devastatingly challenging calculus class. Our goal is to get you to tackle challenges beyond calculus, to discover the variety of disciplines and activities\nat which you might excel, and to explore how your diverse talents and interests can be combined in an education that is unique to you.\n\nFreshman year is designed to introduce you to living and learning in a residential setting. Your courses will focus on honing your reading, writing, and critical thinking skills while exposing you to the broad expanse of human thought and endeavor. The goal is to get you asking questions and to provide you with the intellectual foundation you need to find the answers.\nBy sophomore year you will know how to manage the challenges of Cate’s academic program and the responsibilities of living in\nthe Cate community. You will have the freedom to choose some of your own courses and the opportunity to take high-level classes in different disciplines. Toward the end of the year, you will begin a series of conversations with your faculty advisor about your interests and talents and what you want to have achieved by the time you graduate.\nIn junior year, you begin to take charge of your own education.\nWorking closely with your advisor and relying on the framework you\nestablished at the end of your sophomore year, you will begin selecting courses based on your unique goals and interests and start your college preparation.\nSenior year is when you realize the full benefit of the Cate curriculum. You will have completed most, if not all, of the required\ncourses and can choose from among Cate’s many challenging electives to create your own “year of personal inquiry.” Many seniors also take on faculty-mentored research projects and assume\nleadership positions on campus.","dirAcademics":"Director of Studies Lisa Holmes","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Director of Resident Life Peter Mack","studentLifeSummary":"You may never live in a place more beautiful than Cate. Several dorms overlook the ocean. The beach is close enough for a morning swim or surf. There’s a special bench just for watching sunsets, though some\nwould argue that the views from the \"Pizza Lawn\" are just as spectacular. Behind campus a series of trails lead you to the splendor of the Los Padres National Forest. And you share this space—150 acres of trees and light—with fewer than 350 other people. It’s like having a world all to yourself.\n\nYou’ll live in one of eight remarkably home-like dorms. In addition to your bedroom, there will be places to study, play games,watch movies, and just hang out. Faculty members and their families live in the dorms as well, so you’ll always have an adult to talk to, or the occasional kitchen table to do your homework. You’ll also have a senior prefect—a kind of big brother or sister—to offer guidance and\nsupport as you get the hang of living in your home away from home.\n\nBut the dorms at Cate are more than a place to live, they’re also a place to learn and grow. In fact, your interactions with your dorm parents and prefects and the talks and activities they plan for you are an integrated part of the curriculum. We call it PARK—Persistence, Awareness, Responsibility, and Kindness—and it’s all about learning how to cooperate and collaborate with others.\n\nAnd then there’s the food. The chefs at Raymond Commons prepare meals from scratch and buy as much of their produce, meat, and dairy as possible from local farmers. There’s always a waffle bar at breakfast, sandwich and salad bars at lunch and dinner, as well as frequent theme nights—Italian, Mexican, Breakfast for Dinner. There are always bowls of fruit out for snacking, and many students (and faculty) find themselves wishing for the occasional cold snap just for the pleasure of sitting by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Imagine competing against some of the best high school athletes in the country. Imagine incorporating an ocean swim or a mountain run\ninto your training routine—year round. Imagine playing a new sport—or maybe any sport—for the first time and finding out you’re good at\nit. Imagine heading from the fields to the dining hall with teammates,sweaty and laughing. Imagine becoming a team leader—someone to whom younger players look for advice and who coaches trust to\nhelp them out on the field. That’s the Cate athletic experience.\nCate fields 22 varsity athletic teams, and our quality of play\nis so high—seven titles and championships in 2011-2012, eight in\n2012-2013—that we’re entering the more competitive Tri-County\nAthletic Association in 2014. There are junior varsity and even 3rds teams for many sports, allowing less experienced players to try new\nsports without the pressure of intense competition. Cate also offers intramural options like dancing and surfing, so no matter what your\ninterests or current level of play, you’ll find opportunities to have fun and improve your skills. If you’re already a seasoned athlete, Cate’s coaches will help you\nreach your performance goals. If you’re trying team sports for the very first time, they’ll be patient teachers, eager to share their love of\nthe game. And Cate’s athletic requirement ensures that every student at every level is always trying—and learning—something new.","dirArts":"Fine Arts Department Chair Patrick Collins","dirAthletics":"Fine Arts Department Chair Ransom","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Cate’s college counselors have an easy job. Cate’s small size and tight-knit community allows them to know your needs and interests well, and Cate’s strong, vibrant, academic and extra-curricular programs will allow you to explore and excel in a variety of subjects and activities. By the time you start\nthinking about college in earnest, you’ll be able to make wise and\nwell-informed decisions about your next step.\nYou and your advisor will begin laying the groundwork for your\ncollege exploration during freshman and sophomore years. You’ll be\nable to start that exploration during our Fall College Night series,\nwhich brings representatives from nearly 100 colleges and universities\nto campus to describe their programs and meet Cate students.\nThe formal college counseling process begins in your junior\nyear, when you’ll start taking “college classes” run by the college counseling staff. In the winter you’ll\nbegin meeting individually with one of Cate’s college counselors to\ndiscuss your academic and extracurricular interests, learning style,\nand career goals. In the spring you’ll attend our Case Studies program,\nduring which you’ll meet in small groups with admission deans from\nas many as 40 competitive colleges and universities to learn how\nthe admission process works and how schools evaluate candidates.\nWhen you leave for summer break, your counselor will reinforce your\nprogress with a letter that summarizes the college criteria you have discussed, lists the schools that best fit those criteria, and outlines the\nsteps you can take to hit the ground running. During your senior year, you'll continue to receive regular guidance from your counselor as you narrow choices, complete applications, and receive acceptance letters and financial aid offers. The intent of all this preparation and attention is to have you find and attend a college that is the perfect fit for your unique needs and interests.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Tamar Adegbile","colleges":[{"name":"New York University","attending":22},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":17},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":13},{"name":"University of Chicago","attending":11},{"name":"Colorado College","attending":11},{"name":"Barnard College","attending":9},{"name":"Columbia University","attending":9},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":9},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":8},{"name":"Brown University","attending":7},{"name":"Colby College","attending":7},{"name":"Georgetown University","attending":7},{"name":"Trinity University","attending":7},{"name":"University of St. Andrews","attending":7}],"alumni":[{"name":"David Crosby","year":null,"description":"Singer/Songwriter"},{"name":"Garrett Lisi","year":null,"description":"Notable Physicist"},{"name":"Billy Steinberg","year":null,"description":"Musician/Songwriter"},{"name":"Warren Briedenbach III","year":null,"description":"Pioneering Surgeon"},{"name":"Sir John R.H.

The primary focus of our active curriculum and environment is to successfully prepare our students for college, and beyond.

In many ways our classrooms have become more like laboratories than lecture halls, places where students engage actively in the process of discovery as they produce works of literature, science, and art.\n\nAlong with our approach to teaching and learning, we believe that the curriculum we offer at CH-CH has the potential to transform our students as thinkers and learners.  In keeping with our appreciation of diversity, our curriculum is remarkably rich for a small college preparatory school.  At the beginning levels, we introduce students to foundational skills and content across the disciplines so that they will emerge prepared not only to succeed but also to delight in the electives they choose as juniors and seniors.\"","dirAcademics":" Josh Bubar","campusLifeSummary":"Chapel Hill - Chauncy Hall offers a rich variety of programming to engage and challenge students outside of the classroom. Our student life program aims to involve all students and develop well-rounded individuals. Students form, manage, and organize the clubs at CH-CH; the clubs are comprised of diverse offerings created in response to students’ needs, interests and talents. Our students build self-esteem and confidence; establish healthy relationships; overcome challenges; realize their excellence; grow their leadership abilities; and become independent. \n\nWe also provide many opportunities for our students to become leaders and involved members of our community. For example, students can become resident advisors in the dorms, participate in student government, and partake in numerous opportunities for community service both on and off the campus. \n\nAfter a week of hard work and studying, the weekends are a time for students to have fun, explore, and relax with friends. There is always a full schedule of weekend activities for both boarding and day students to participate in. Our weekend activities coordinator makes sure that there is a variety of activities each weekend, including museum trips, trips into Boston, and outings to restaurants and shopping centers.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Residential Life Lori White","studentLifeSummary":"Our students pursue interests, bond with classmates, contribute to the community, and have fun with a variety of activities during the class day, which includes a meeting period for student clubs. Clubs include Drama, Student Government, Amnesty International, International Student Organization, Students of Color Alliance, and the Gay/Straight Alliance.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Students have several opportunities to participate in mandatory afternoon activities. We offer traditional interscholastic sports, as well as fitness training and less traditional options such as badminton and rock climbing. Other activities may include robotics, newspaper, drama, and tech crew. Seasoned athletes, as well as those trying a sport for the first time, have the opportunity to participate, develop their skills, and enjoy the camaraderie of being on a team.\n\n\nThe arts enrich the CH-CH experience both as academic courses and as co-curricular activities. In the visual arts, courses are offered in photography, digital art, ceramics, sculpture, art history, and studio art. The most dedicated artists can pursue our concentrated program to earn a Certificate of Distinction in Visual Art. In the performing arts, students choose from a variety of courses, such as From Set to Stage: Introduction to Theater Practices, Chamber Ensemble and Piano. Through the Drama Program, students have the opportunity to participate in three major shows during the year, including one musical.","dirArts":"Art Department Chair Jamie Palmer Keating","dirAthletics":"Art Department Chair White","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The goal of our College Counseling Program is to help students find the right college “match,\" where the student will learn effectively, enjoy and contribute to their next community, as well as reach his or her full potential. With the College Counseling Program students are armed with the requisite knowledge to make good decisions and submit applications that are both professional in quality and true reflections of each student’s unique personality, character, and ability.\n\nThe centerpiece of CH-CH’s program is individual counseling. In formulating a college list, each student works with the Director of College Counseling to explore his/her academic and extracurricular interests and optimal school community, size, and location. Students consult with the counselor at each step of the process, such as developing resumes, writing essays, preparing for interviews, and completing applications. Through active and personalized interactions with students, the counselor and teachers are able to write very personal letters of recommendation that prove an invaluable component of student application packets.\n\nSeveral programs supplement this one-on-one counseling. The junior program begins in earnest in January and includes guest speakers, participation in college fairs, test prep opportunities, a financial aid seminar, and the beginning of regular and frequent individual meetings. During the junior year, students and parents also begin using Family Connection by Naviance – a web-based application that is a valuable resource to help students, parents, and the counselor work together throughout the college admission process.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Brooke Fincke","colleges":[{"name":"Brown University","attending":1},{"name":"Vassar College","attending":2},{"name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","attending":2},{"name":"Boston College","attending":1},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":1}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[{"quote":"\"When I was looking at schools, I noticed CH-CH’s diversity right away.

You might meet up for “Bad Movie Night” or attend a Pinata Throw-Down (hosted at a faculty house), whip up a gourmet meal (with a little help from a dorm parent), or get schooled in the fine art of tire changing. Depending on the season, you’ll also find students carving pumpkins, building gingerbread houses, and hunting for Easter eggs.\n\nOff campus, there’s even more to do. The school regularly hosts ski trips to the Wintergreen Resort and shopping excursions to Durham, N.C., plus cultural jaunts to the North Carolina Art Museum and Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Another winter-term favorite? Ice-skating in Lynchburg, Virginia.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Visual Arts Dept.

It is the home of the Deans of Students, the International Student Coordinators, and the Director of Student Activities. \n\nCheshire Academy is a vibrant community where learning occurs not only during the academic day but also in dorms, on the stage, in rehearsals and performances, during on and off campus events, in the evenings, and on the weekends. There are many Community Service opportunities, such as volunteer work at day care and senior centers, the Soup Kitchen in New Haven, and the Food Pantry in Cheshire. Dorm activities include food fests, dorm competitions, and restaurant and movie trips. The International Student Coordinators provide ongoing support and cultural experiences for our diverse group of students from around the globe. \n\nThere is never a dull moment on the weekends. Activities are planned to entertain a wide variety of interests. Typical offerings include outdoor movies, cooking in the Student Center, intramural competitions, talent shows and recitals, paintball trips, cultural outings in New Haven and Hartford, bowling and ice skating, and even a Mystery Shuttle.\n\n\n\nCheshire Academy is located just 20 minutes north of New Haven and 20 minutes south of Hartford, so a wide range of weekend activities — trips to local attractions, restaurants, and cultural events — are offered year-round. Popular past activities include: an indoor soccer tournament; trip to a local orchard and corn maze; a Moon Festival dinner; a multi-prep school dance and open gym events; shuttles to nearby malls; “under the lights” football games; NYC trips; open gym, fitness center, swimming pool, and weight room; off-campus “mystery trips”; outdoor movies and food on the quad; paint ball; Ropes Course Challenge; pep rallies; and on-campus performances.","dirCampusLife":"Associate Head of School for Community Life and At David Dykeman","studentLifeSummary":"The student body at Cheshire Academy comprises both day and boarding students. Boarders account for approximately two thirds of our school, with domestic and international students residing in Horton Hall, Hurley Hall, Markin Hall, Motter Hall, and Von der Porten Hall. Each dormitory is a single-sex facility housing faculty apartments and daily supervision by trained Residential Life faculty and dorm affiliates. Student proctors and residential advisors serve as important liaisons between our students and Residential Life faculty throughout the year.\n\n\nAt Cheshire, community life and education go hand in hand. Our Residential Life faculty and dorm affiliates can also be found instructing in classrooms, coaching on the fields, and hanging out in the dorms ready to offer a hand after school. In loco parentis, our Residential Life faculty offer both the wisdom of the classroom and all forms of TLC after the traditional school day ends — whether it’s hosting a movie night in a faculty apartment, baking brownies for an evening snack, or providing additional assistance with homework during evening study hall hours. Regularly scheduled dorm community programs take place on a weekly basis. Boarders have a chance to learn and chat about health and wellness issues, diversity and culture, and other important social topics — or sometimes just to share in a late night pizza, games, and good conversation.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Cheshire Academy, founded in 1794, offers a stimulating college-preparatory and International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program that strives at each level to help every student realize his or her potential.

They’ll collaborate with you to create your most effective and engaging academic plan, and help you to chart your goals for the future — including your ideal choice of college and target career pursuits.","dirAcademics":"Director of Curricular Initiatives Katie Jewett","campusLifeSummary":"Choate cultivates a vibrant community of principled individuals from diverse backgrounds and unites them through common purpose, active engagement, and mutual respect.\n\nWe value shared experiences and traditions that shape character, build cohesion, generate school spirit, and foster lifelong connections.\n\nCharacteristics central to the character of the Choate community are integrity, respect, and compassion. \n\nStudents, faculty, staff, and families live by the Choate Rosemary Hall Statement of Expectations.\n\nTwo interwoven priorities define the Choate experience: a rigorous academic curriculum and an emphasis on the formation of character in a setting that allows teachers and students to live with and learn from each other. The values inherent in living with other students and adults are every bit as important as the lessons taught in the classroom. Through the boarding experience students learn how to live as responsible members of the community: respecting their fellow students and adults; treating the physical environment with care; recognizing the safety of the entire community, learning sensitivity to differences; and embracing the values of Choate Rosemary Hall.\n\nChoate has a variety of residences to choose from: large, dynamic dormitories, to small close-knit houses. Each of the houses has one or more faculty members (and their families!) living with, and serving as advisers to our students. Older students serve as prefects to counsel and guide younger students throughout their experience.\n\nDay student life capitalizes upon the rigorous academic experience Choate offers, is augmented by robust student life opportunities that transcend into evening and weekends, yet balanced by the comforts of home. While day students live at home and commute to our campus, they are active and fully engaged members of the Choate community. Commitments to clubs, activities, teams, and academic pursuits encourage day students to explore life on campus to the fullest extent – just like their boarding peers. Day students are welcome to join the boarding community for all meals, to remain on campus until curfew, and to participate in all weekend activities, even to be hosted for weekend overnights on campus. Most day students would agree that it is hard to call it a day and head towards home. In fact, many would say they spend more time on campus than at home.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Will Morris","studentLifeSummary":"An educational and social hub for the Choate community, the 37,000-square foot, three-story St. John Hall student center includes spaces for small and large group gatherings, the Choate Store and Tuck Shop Café, Deans' and Student Activities offices, meeting rooms, student project rooms, game room, media room, publication studios and club spaces.","artsAthleticsSummary":"What makes the arts such a powerful part of life and learning at Choate? It's music, dance, art, and performance. It's more than 50 classes in the visual and performing arts. It's exceptional experiences. It's hundreds of events on the stage, in the studios and galleries. It's a culture that celebrates creative endeavor as an essential part of a great education. And, it's the chance to take your talents further. \n\nWhat's great about Choate athletics? It's something for everyone with 81 interscholastic teams - varsity, junior varsity, and thirds - in 32 sports. It's a program focused on learning sportsmanship, testing limits, and striving for excellence. It's outstanding facilities. It's donning the blue and gold for one of the great rivalries in sports: Choate-Deerfield Day. It's a winning tradition, with recent league and New England championships in several sports. And, it's recognition of our athletes at the collegiate, professional and international level.","dirArts":"Director of the Arts Kalya Yannatos","dirAthletics":"Director of the Athletics Eford","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The College Counseling Office seeks to arm students with the tools necessary to conduct a thorough college search.

is a boarding and day school for talented boys in grades nine through twelve. CFS offers a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum in an intimate setting, with a total enrollment of less than 200 and an average class size of just 10 students.  \n\nThe curriculum offers numerous advanced placement and honors courses, and is designed to prepare our students to gain entrance to and succeed at the finest colleges and universities. Our curriculum is technology-infused, with each student receiving his own MacBook and with internet access in every classroom and dorm room. Instruction is led by a seasoned faculty with an average tenure of more than 15 years and of whom 70% hold advanced degrees; most live within five minutes of campus. \n\nEducation at CFS, however, is not limited to the traditional classroom. Students learn equally important lessons on our athletic fields competing in interscholastic sports, and in our music program, with advanced offerings in choir, jazz and music history and theory. Students can explore their creative side in the expansive art studio, with classes in a variety of media including clay, graphic design and printmaking. Hobbies become passions, and perhaps careers, in nearly 20 extra-curricular clubs and activities, ranging from guitar, DECA and Interact to STEM, robotics and our literary magazine and student newspaper.  \n\nThe vital importance of character, caring and giving back to the community is stressed through a renowned community service program that saw students donate 3,500 hours to community organizations last year alone. Our inclusive chapel program allows each student to explore the spiritual elements in his life.","dirAdmissions":"Michael Foster","phone":"610-363-7500","admissionsPhone":"610-363-5347","fax":"610-280-6746","email":"mfoster@gocfs.net","academicSummary":"Our challenging curriculum is designed to help each student reach his academic potential.

They pursue a rigorous college preparatory curriculum, one that challenges and, at the same time, develops creativity and intellectual maturity. Teachers foster such growth in a structured and caring atmosphere for learning.\n\nClasses at the Academy are small—eleven students is the average size—and are defined by the participation of every student. The goal of the Academy is not just academic excellence in the topic at hand, but the development of the intellectual capacity and desire to educate oneself in all topics. Indeed, Deerfield is defined by an emphasis on well-roundedness in learning, in preparation for a life well lived.\n\nThere is exhilaration in the learning process—an excitement with which students here are familiar.  Deerfield offers a wide array of courses so that each student has the opportunity to enroll in a challenging and interesting curriculum.

the 1970's, a group of educators banded together to transform education using new fundamentals. They had observed that conventional schools were failing too many bright students. These educators were committed to making a difference. That difference is Delphian.\n\nAt Delphian, you won’t find teachers lecturing while students rotely take notes. You will find students actively engaged in learning, studying independently and moving at the speed that is right for them.\n\nYou’ll see lively one-on-one and small group discussions on works of literature, art, business, science or current events. You’ll see students creating clay models to explain and demonstrate a concept, a student giving a presentation on his apprenticeship experience or a topic he’s just researched, and students heading to the science lab or out into the world to test or explore a theory.\n\nThe Delphi Program is designed to help students relate what they’re learning to how they will use this information to succeed in life. Our students live their education from the moment they walk into our school.\n\nOur faculty excel at keeping students motivated and on track with their studies, and you can rest assured that each student receives highly personal attention—every academic program is individually designed to best cater to that student's academic needs and interests. Each student at Delphian is treated as an individual, and we seek to help all of them find their own purpose and use for their education.\n\nSome things you have to see to believe. Delphian is one of them.

Credit is earned through demonstration of ability and mastery of materials studied. Graduation requires of every student proven skills in critical thinking, ethics, communication, teamwork and leadership; hundreds of hours of self-generated projects covering several major ability zones; and solid grounding in the traditional academic subjects with an emphasis on classic literature. Reason, creativity and integrity, in conjunction with free and open inquiry, are given the highest priority in all areas and levels of the program.","dirAcademics":"Dean Kelly Hepburn","campusLifeSummary":"Boarding school is a 24/7 learning environment that challenges students to develop decision-making skills, time management abilities, and a strong sense of independence and responsibility.\n\nAcademics are, of course, a huge part of each weekday. Once classes are finished, our students jump into a variety of afternoon activities – sports, music, art, drama, photography and many more elective courses to keep them challenged. \n\nMore than three-quarters of our students are boarders, and they do more than live here—they own the school. Our students take responsibility for everything from keeping their dormitories clean to caring for the grounds to managing the snack bar and planning and organizing weekend trips.\n\nStudent Council members do much of the weekend activity planning, which might include heading off campus to catch a play, movie, or sporting event in Portland; take part in a community service activity; go ice skating or skiing, camping or shopping. \n\nOn-campus events might include a nighttime game of Capture the Flag and a bonfire, a special dance, or Friday Night Performance, where students take the stage to sing, act, dance, or perform songs from their favorite bands.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Services Mary Price","studentLifeSummary":"Delphian's 24/7 learning environment and program\nprovides opportunities for students to practice life skills such as decision making, effective communication, time management, and goal setting and attainment and learning the importance of creating ones life.  \n\n\nStudents stay challenged with a variety of afternoon activities – sports, music, art, drama, computers, creative writing, photography and many more elective courses. They may find themselves singing in our award-winning choirs (more than half of Delphian’s Upper School students are members),  taking corner kicks for the soccer team, setting up a photo shoot, writing a script and then producing a video, focusing on their Warrior pose in a yoga exercise class, or perfecting their backhand on the tennis court. \n\n\nIn their downtime, Delphian students might get together with friends in the recreation room, work on their jump shots in the gym, participate in a music rehearsal, get in some extra study time, or just relax in the dorm. One thing’s for sure: our students never have to look too far to find a friend, a study partner, or a teammate.\n\nThe program is designed for students to practice using what they are learning, enhanced by faculty who are determined to see true competence demonstrated and always there to help and encourage when needed.","artsAthleticsSummary":"A well-rounded education requires more than a focus on core subjects like math, English, science, and history. Arts and athletics are also important components. That’s why each afternoon, Delphian students take part in a wide variety of elective activities outside the classroom. We refer to these regularly scheduled afternoon classes as “co-curricular” as they include subjects we consider essential to acquiring a full education. All Delphian students are required to participate in elective afternoon classes.\n\nIn afternoon classes, you may find yourself singing with our award-winning choirs (more than half of Delphian’s Upper School students are members). Taking corner kicks for the soccer team. Setting up a photoshoot. Writing a script and then producing a video. Focusing on your Warrior pose in yoga class. Perfecting your backhand on the tennis court. Whatever you do, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to share your talent and skills with an audience, whether it’s sports fans cheering you on from the sidelines or a standing ovation at curtain call.\n\nCo-Curricular activities may include music, art, pottery, drama, choir, computers, creative writing, video production, photography, woodshop, yoga (as exercise), weightlifting, and a variety of interscholastic sports such as soccer, volleyball, basketball, baseball, softball and tennis.","dirArts":"Arts Director Craig Bader","dirAthletics":"Arts Director Lidgard","notable":["Multiple State Titles/Placement - Varsity Choir","Multiple State Titles/Placement - Varsity Soccer","Multiple State Titles/Placement-Varsity Volleybal"],"collegeSummary":"Delphian's career and college counselor works one-on-one with every student to tailor their academic program around their goals for college placement, with a focus on best fit. \n\nDue to the nature of the Delphi Program, students have the ability to study additional courses in areas of interest (math, computer science, the arts, etc), as well as to take on exciting projects and internships.

Academic work here aims to prepare students for college, and for the journey of building rich and positive lives. Our academic program grows from the legacy of Paul Lehmann, and his emphasis on hard work and high standards, and the values of progressive education in the midst of a small New England village, surrounded by the beauty of the forests, Mount Monadnock, and Dublin Lake. Education here is based on Dublin’s early belief in involving every student in taking responsibility and caring for the school, the town, and the larger community, and for the natural world. Dublin’s commitment to incorporating many kinds of people and learners, to creating many kinds of learning experiences, and to the growth of healthy adolescents, all derive from this legacy. Our academic program invites students to read ever more deeply, to write and speak with increasing effectiveness, to solve problems creatively and efficiently, to explore scientific fields, to learn languages, and to draw, to make music, and to be moved by works of beauty. Students leave Dublin School as strong individuals who are ready to participate in the globalizing society of the 21st century.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Sarah Doenmez","campusLifeSummary":"Dublin students are caring and involved in many activities.

It's an adventure where you learn to become independent and responsible. Sure, you have chores and expectations - like a dorm job, laundry, and keeping your room clean. But you also have the freedom and excitement of living away from home.\n\n\nBoarding life prepares you for college.\nWhen you get to college, other freshmen will be new to living in a dorm - but you'll already be a pro. You'll know how to manage your time and balance work and play. This advantage gives you a big head start toward making the most of your college years.\n\n\nIs Boarding for you?\nFor many students, boarding life is a favorite part of their Dunn education. By living on campus with Dunn's resident faculty and other like-minded students in a tight community, you can find your own identity, develop your talents, enjoy a 'home-away-from-home' and make friends for life.

An experienced faculty, small classes (average is 11), 45 advanced courses, and integrated technology (with laptop computer program) support the pursuit of academic excellence. Highlights include extensive offerings in arts and athletics; frequent study in Washington, D.C. (10 minutes away), including senior internships; study abroad opportunities; spiritual and moral education with one of the nation's oldest Honor Codes. Our 130-acre campus includes new centers for science, the arts, and athletics.","dirAdmissions":"Scott Conklin","phone":"703-933-4062","admissionsPhone":"703-933-4062","fax":"703-933-3016","email":"admissions@episcopalhighschool.org","academicSummary":"Episcopal High School's academic program prepares students for success in college and beyond by providing a rigorous liberal arts education enriched by technology and hands-on learning.  Students are challenged by talented faculty in small classes that encourage quality interactions. A variety of teaching methods are used that incorporate current pedagogy and reflect a diversity of learning styles.  \n\nAn Episcopal High School education is more than just acquired knowledge - it is also discovery, exploration, creativity, and collaboration.  Students and faculty work together in a learning community to make the most of each subject, whether engaging in lively classroom discussion and debates, analyzing the meaning behind a poem or work of art, or utilizing technology to create an innovative solution to a problem.  \n\nThe Washington Program gives students the opportunity to explore the city, learning from and collaborating with experts from organizations affecting change on a national level. Our teachers take full advantage of the many opportunities in the Washington, D.C. area to enhance classroom work.  Students might read \"Macbeth\" and then see it performed on stage, or study environmental science in the lab and then carry out field work on the Potomac River.  Episcopal attracts students with a wide variety of academic talents, and the School strives to address each student's needs.  Regular, honors, advanced, and college-level courses in each department allow students to tailor their learning track, and if they wish to explore a subject not offered in the curriculum, there is also the opportunity for independent study.","dirAcademics":"Assistant Head for Academics Mary Fielder","campusLifeSummary":"Living on dorm is at the heart of Episcopal culture: EHS's eight dorms - four for boys and four for girls - quickly become \"home,\" where teachers and students celebrate birthdays, indulge in spontaneous midnight pancakes, and hold intense conversations around the kitchen table.  Led by a dorm head with a resident faculty member on every floor, each dormitory is a community where students support and champion one another - from helping to carry a new student's luggage on the first day to attending dorm-mates' debuts in plays or athletic games.  To ease the boarding school transition, freshmen live in their own dorms and have earlier check-in and lights-out times, plus extra faculty members on the dorm team.  Additionally, Monitors - seniors selected by the faculty and student body - help coordinate dorm life.  Students have one or two roommates, new students have roommates in the same grade, and all are responsible for their room upkeep and laundry.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Head of Student Life Douglas Dickson","studentLifeSummary":"The Episcopal experience is rooted in self-discovery guided by supportive adults.  Our extraordinary residential community provides the perfect opportunities - both in and out of the classroom - for such discovery to occur.  Living on dorm with classmates and teachers as neighbors inspires formative, lifelong friendships.  The experience starts with academics and moves outward to the arts, athletics, school trips, community service, and takes full advantage of our location right outside Washington DC with ample opportunities to engage with all the city has to offer.  The many choices - to participate on an athletic team, in a performance, in a club, with a student publication, to play a card game or laser tag - are joyous opportunities for students to determine who they are and to work with others toward mutual goals.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Arts - At Episcopal, we know that the arts feed creativity, and creativity stimulates cognitive perception, awareness, and intellect.  That's why we offer a comprehensive arts program through which students have an extraordinary opportunity to excel in their chosen art form, or to explore newly discovered interests and talents.  In the state-of-the-art Ainslie Arts Center, students pursue all levels of study and practice in the performing and visual arts.  This dynamic curriculum includes exposure to the rich artistic and cultural treasures of Washington, D.C., and master workshops with well-known performers and artists.  EHS students have a rare opportunity to work at what they love and experience the challenges of creative practice - supported by adults who are themselves accomplished professionals.\n\nAthletics - Episcopal believes that physical exercise and conditioning are very important to the health of every teenage boy and girl and that habits and routines of exercise begun at a young age are important to lifelong health.  EHS is also committed to the values taught by athletic competition.  Sportsmanship, self-discipline, and perseverance are often learned through interscholastic sports.  Most importantly, Episcopal's athletic teams provide an opportunity for students from diverse backgrounds to learn the value of teamwork, cooperation, and mutual respect.  Episcopal's athletics facilities rank among the finest of any high school in the nation and each year, Episcopal fields 46 interscholastic teams (including 27 varsity and 19 lower level teams) in 18 different sports.  More than 375 students per year participate on these teams, and most freshmen and sophomores participate in interscholastic competition during all three seasons.","dirArts":"Chair of Arts Mark Carter","dirAthletics":"Chair of Arts Fitzpatrick","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"When our graduates leave Episcopal High School's gates, without exception their journeys continue at colleges and universities that best complement their talents, ambitions, interests, and learning styles. Our alumni attend many of the most highly  selective institutions in the country, including honors colleges at state universities. Our dedicated team of college counselors guides both students and parents through every aspect of the college admissions process.\n\nInformally, the process can begin as early as sophomore year when students are invited to attend college fairs and meetings with visiting admissions teams. Formal college counseling begins junior year with individual meetings and an orientation session designed to help students understand the application process. Our counselors personally monitor and assist with college planning throughout a student's junior and senior years. They help students indentify the college and universities where they will thrive - where the student will feel both supported and challenged. Our counselors, who maintain contact with respected colleges and universities nationwide, are especially able to determine whether a school is a good fit for a student.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Tara Maglio","colleges":[{"name":"Agnes Scott College","attending":1},{"name":"American University","attending":2},{"name":"Amherst College","attending":1},{"name":"Assumption College","attending":1},{"name":"Barnard College","attending":3},{"name":"Belmont University","attending":1},{"name":"Boston College","attending":2},{"name":"Boston University","attending":1},{"name":"Bowdoin College","attending":2},{"name":"Brandeis University","attending":1},{"name":"Brown University","attending":4},{"name":"Bucknell University","attending":3},{"name":"California Institute of Technology","attending":1},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","attending":2},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","attending":1},{"name":"Centre College","attending":1},{"name":"Chapman University","attending":1},{"name":"Claremont McKenna College","attending":1},{"name":"Clemson University","attending":6},{"name":"Colgate University","attending":3},{"name":"College of Charleston","attending":4},{"name":"College of William and Mary","attending":12},{"name":"Colorado College","attending":4},{"name":"Columbia University","attending":4},{"name":"Connecticut College","attending":2},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":2},{"name":"Dartmouth College","attending":2},{"name":"Davidson College","attending":7},{"name":"Denison University","attending":7},{"name":"DePaul University","attending":1},{"name":"Dickinson College","attending":5},{"name":"Drew University","attending":1},{"name":"Duke University","attending":2},{"name":"Elon University","attending":8},{"name":"Emory University","attending":2},{"name":"Fairfield University","attending":1},{"name":"Florida State University","attending":1},{"name":"Franklin & Marshall College","attending":3},{"name":"Furman University","attending":2},{"name":"George Mason University","attending":1},{"name":"Georgetown University","attending":4},{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","attending":3},{"name":"Gettysburg College","attending":1},{"name":"Hamilton College","attending":2},{"name":"Hampden-Sydney College","attending":1},{"name":"Hampton University","attending":3},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":2},{"name":"Haverford College","attending":4},{"name":"Hillsdale College","attending":1},{"name":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","attending":3},{"name":"James Madison University","attending":1},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","attending":2},{"name":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology","attending":1},{"name":"Lehigh University","attending":1},{"name":"Les Roches International School of Hotel Management","attending":1},{"name":"Lewis & Clark College","attending":1},{"name":"Longwood University","attending":1},{"name":"Louisiana State University","attending":1},{"name":"Loyola Marymount University","attending":1},{"name":"McMaster University","attending":1},{"name":"Miami University (Oxford, OH)","attending":2},{"name":"Middlebury College","attending":2},{"name":"Montana State University","attending":1},{"name":"New York University","attending":8},{"name":"Newcastle University","attending":1},{"name":"North Carolina State University","attending":1},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":1},{"name":"Northwestern University","attending":6},{"name":"Oberlin College","attending":2},{"name":"Ohio Wesleyan University","attending":1},{"name":"Oklahoma State University","attending":1},{"name":"Pennsylvania State University","attending":2},{"name":"Princeton University","attending":2},{"name":"Purdue University","attending":2},{"name":"Queen's University","attending":1},{"name":"Rhodes College","attending":6},{"name":"Rice University","attending":3},{"name":"Rollins College","attending":1},{"name":"Rutgers University","attending":3},{"name":"Saint Joseph's University","attending":1},{"name":"Santa Clara Unviversity","attending":2},{"name":"Savannah College of Art and Design","attending":1},{"name":"Sewanee: The University of the South","attending":14},{"name":"Southern Methodist University","attending":17},{"name":"St. Lawrence Unviersity","attending":2},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":1},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":1},{"name":"Texas A&M University","attending":1},{"name":"Texas Christian University","attending":4},{"name":"Texas Tech University","attending":1},{"name":"The College of New Jersey","attending":1},{"name":"The George Washington University","attending":4},{"name":"The University of Alabama","attending":5},{"name":"The University of Arizona","attending":5},{"name":"The University of Georgia","attending":7},{"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","attending":25},{"name":"The University of Texas at Austin","attending":5},{"name":"Trinity College","attending":9},{"name":"Trinity College -

The boarding program has special monthly activities, ranging from visiting local ski resorts, enjoying some of Southern California’s finest beaches, shopping at the outlets in the desert city of Palm Springs, or having fun at a nearby amusement park, such as Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knott’s Berry Farm or Magic Mountain.

Students are graded on effort and diligence in all of the arts classes. We provide an extensive arts education for students who wish to participate in the classes we offer.  \n\n\t\nThe FSHA Athletic Program believes that participation in a variety of student-selected athletic activities is a vital part of the educational experience.

Each student’s physical development is an important element of the curriculum not only because a sound physical condition is necessary for mental and spiritual well being, but also because an awareness of the importance of exercise for life-long health should be developed in adolescence. Finally, sports provide a unique opportunity for molding character and building lasting friendships, and for the great but simple pleasure of play.\n\nAthletics and physical development are an integral part of the total learning environment, where the teacher is seen as coach, the coach as teacher. About 40 percent of the faculty coach at least one sport.

college-preparatory academic program that features a wide diversity of course options. In addition to our core curriculum, we also offer classes in woodworking, engineering, architectural drafting, book arts, personal finance, and accounting, among others. Our course catalog includes over 120 classes, offered at every level from beginner to advanced instruction. Honors and Advanced Placement courses are available. In addition, students may enroll in a physics course at Maine Maritime Academy, for which they receive both high school and college credit.\n\n\nAll 9th grade students enroll in Freshmen Seminar. This class provides 20 minutes of instruction in areas such as study skills, test taking, time management, and other executive functioning skills. Then, there are 45 minutes for individual study and extra help.\n\n\nJuniors and seniors in good academic standing may elect to undertake an independent study or internship project for two-three weeks in late February-early March. Projects are supervised by a faculty advisor and an outside “expert.” One-half credit is awarded for successful completion of Independent Study & Internship Project (ISIP). \n\nThere were 24 individual AP Scholars in the Class of 2017. Including 3 National Scholars. This represents 50% of all students who took an AP course.\n \nAn Alternative Course Contract provides an opportunity for a student to take a course not offered in the regular curriculum. A student, in consultation with the Office of Student Services and a member of the GSA faculty, may design the curriculum and write a course proposal that includes a description of the course, goals, and objectives, and the amount of credit to be earned. Once approved, the student works under the direction of the faculty member to complete the course.\n\nISIP and Alternative Course Contracts are unique opportunities.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Curriculum and Instruction David Stearns","campusLifeSummary":"Campus Life at George Stevens Academy is dynamic, fun, and rewarding. Our unique location on the coast of Maine gives our students many opportunities to explore - from day trips with a local lobsterman to blueberry picking at a nearby farm to hiking in breathtaking Acadia National Park. There are also plenty of things happening right on our campus, with clubs and activities ranging from theater to chess club. Afternoons are often filled with sports or other extra-curriculars, and students often go out into the community to volunteer at the local hospital, music lending library, soup kitchen, and elementary schools. Our chef prepares fresh, diverse, delicious meals in our cafe each night. Study hall in the library provides some quiet time to get homework done or receive tutoring and extra help. Finally, back in the dorm, students can unwind after a busy day, socialize, and catch up with family back at home before getting to bed for a good night's rest.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Elizabeth Moss","studentLifeSummary":"Students live in small, comfortable dormitories on campus. They have private bathrooms down the hall from their rooms. Most dorm rooms are doubles. Later, a few students may have the option of applying for a home stay, if they wish. Host families are very involved in the life of the school and often have children of their own who attend the school, are recent graduates, or will attend when they are older. Residential students, whether they live in the dormitory or a home stay, are invited to participate in all the after-school and weekend extra-curricular activities.","artsAthleticsSummary":"At the end of May, a week is devoted to Arts Fest. Artists from all over visit GSA to share expertise in dance, music, film, painting, poetry, creative writing, woodworking, blacksmithing, photography, etc. Students participate in morning workshops and enjoy afternoon performances and demonstrations. Students may participate in intensive, multi-day arts workshops at nearby Haystack Mountain School. GSA offers outstanding opportunities in musical arts. The school is particularly known for its Jazz Band and Steel Drum bands.\n\nStudents may choose to participate in competitive interscholastic sports and recreational sports. GSA is particularly know for its competitive basketball, tennis, and baseball.","dirArts":"Chair, Fine Arts Department Mariel Duym","dirAthletics":"Chair, Fine Arts Department Gray","notable":["16 jazz band state championships in 26 years","State Champion Girls Cross Country","2x Maine State Champions in Boys Basketball"],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College and Vocational Counseling Katy Rinehart","colleges":[{"name":"Princeton","attending":2},{"name":"UMaine","attending":17},{"name":"Conn College","attending":2},{"name":"Vassar","attending":1},{"name":"UMaine Farmington","attending":8},{"name":"Dartmouth","attending":1},{"name":"Cornell","attending":1},{"name":"Univ of Calif various","attending":10}],"alumni":[],"alumniQuotes":[{"quote":"GSA was very different my first days here, but the people here are very friendly, and the teachers are very good teachers.

Preparatory School is an independent, Jesuit college-preparatory school for young men. Founded in 1789, Prep is the nation's oldest Catholic boys' boarding and day school. Prep's academically rigorous liberal arts curriculum is based in the educational philosophy of Jesuit founder, St. Ignatius Loyola: a belief in reflection, discernment, scholarly excellence, and personal responsibility, as well as the importance of being \"Men for Others.\" Nationally recognized athletic and fine arts programs with close access to Washington's museums and seat of government compliment the academic program.","dirAdmissions":"Brett Graham","phone":"301-493-5000","admissionsPhone":"301-214-1215","fax":"301-493-6128","email":"admissions@gprep.org","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"  ","campusLifeSummary":"Georgetown Prep is the oldest Catholic Preparatory School and the only Jesuit boarding school in the United States. Founded in 1789, the year the Constitution was ratified and George Washington became President, Prep has now formed men of “competence, conscience, courage, and compassion” for America and the world throughout the course of four different centuries.\n\nThe Resident Program is an essential component of Prep’s mission. A dedicated and professional staff, comprised of both Jesuit and lay educators, lives in a cohesive and mutually supportive community with the residents. Under the guidance of a Resident Dean, Assistant Resident Dean, four Housemasters, four Assistant Housemasters, seven Prefects, and three Jesuits living on corridor (a staff/resident ratio of 1:5), residents are provided with quality supervision and guidance in all aspects of their lives. The Resident Staff is devoted to creating a fun and active environment that maintains a healthy balance between the good order and discipline essential to a successful boarding program, but which also fosters the mentoring relationships essential to developing a young man’s full potential and character.\n\nPrep’s Resident Program offers residents the complete high school experience. They are continually encouraged to try harder, strive farther, and accomplish all that they are capable of in the classroom, on the athletic field, and in life in general—and they share this journey with residents from nearly 20 different countries and states! Through the time-proven tradition of Jesuit education, residents receive the human, academic, and spiritual formation necessary to become “men for others” in a 21st century world.","dirCampusLife":"Residential Dean Joesph Harkins","studentLifeSummary":"There is much more to Georgetown Prep than classes and athletic competitions, and campus surely doesn't shut down at 3 o'clock. Extracurricular opportunities are unlimited at Prep, from the Prep Players to school publications to Physics Club and more. Students can also create new clubs and activities.\n\nPrep's Resident Program offers students an opportunity they would have nowhere else in the world. The program brings the students and faculty together in a supportive and nurturing environment. On weeknights, students are required to participate in study hall, during which they complete their school work. Following study hall, they meet for group prayer and reflection on the day. On weekends, Prep’s proximity to Washington, D.C. and the Metro transit system offers students the opportunity to explore cultural, educational and recreational activities unique to the nation’s capital. Prep provides interesting activities every weekend for its residents, such as mixers and trips to athletic events.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":" Gary Daum","dirAthletics":" Paro","notable":["IAC Founders Cup Champions 9 years in a row","Metro Swimming Champions 7 Years in a Row","Lacrosse Ranked in top 10 in the country"],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Stephen Maczynski","colleges":[{"name":"Georgetown University","attending":35},{"name":"Boston College","attending":25},{"name":"University of Virginia","attending":18},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":16},{"name":"University of Notre Dame","attending":15}],"alumni":[{"name":"Brian Cashman","year":1985,"description":"General Manager of the New York Yankees"},{"name":"Mo Rocca","year":1987,"description":"Comedian/Entertainer"}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"ESL enrichment, Summer athletic programs, Latin and Math enrichment, Drama program.","dirSummer":"Blake","summerPrograms":[{"name":"ESL","start":"2016-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Intensive English as a second language program for international students.

We are a school that believes that the primary educational aim is to teach students to become independent, curious, self-motivated learners. Our emphasis, therefore, is on process, on active involvement from students—questioning, experimenting, exploring, connecting, communicating, researching, investigating, creating. We value highly each student’s unique contribution to the learning environment and promote an awareness and celebration of the various perspectives offered by students from around the country and the world.\n\nOur faculty is wholly invested in supporting students as they engage in the learning process. We are proud of the sense of humility and respect with which both students and adults approach the learning process at Hebron. It is one ultimately based on the highest regard for personal and community growth.\n\nHebron’s 1-to-1 iPad program and extensive technology in the classrooms ensures that fresh new approaches are incorporated in our teaching and keep Hebron on the cutting edge of an ever-changing world of teaching and learning.\n\nGraduates leave Hebron prepared for higher education in top colleges and universities nationally and internationally. They gain a greater understanding of themselves and the knowledge and confidence to make a difference in the world.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Christine Hemmings","campusLifeSummary":"Hebron is first and foremost a family, enabled by the small size of the community and the immense opportunities that spring from such an intimate, unique atmosphere. Head of School John King remarks, \"Hebron Academy is known for its friendly, supportive environment that encourages young people to reach their potential. Here, teachers encourage students to reach for something more than they thought possible, students are comfortable trying new things and seeking help and guidance from their teachers, everyone is encouraged to be actively involved in the school community, and each person can and does make a difference.\"","dirCampusLife":"Director of Student Life Alex Godomsky","studentLifeSummary":"The Community Life Team along with residential faculty is committed to planning activities for students throughout the year, including special events, sports tournaments, activities in the dorm, and a full slate of choices for the weekends. These activities are in addition to the wide array of existing student plays and concerts, student organization activities and interscholastic competitions.\n\nThe Academy also surprises students with a Mountain Day each year, sweeping kids off campus to enjoy a day of hiking, skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing at a local resort. Hebron's pristine 1,500 acres lends itself to limitless outdoor exploration.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Arts: To be truly well educated, one must not only appreciate the arts, but have rich opportunities to actively participate in creative work. The arts bring subjects to life, turning abstractions into actual expression. Learning through the arts often results in greater academic achievement and higher test scores. The arts faculty bring a high level of experience to the classroom, and throughout the year visiting artists and musicians come to campus, exposing students to a wide range of creativity and talent. At Hebron, art is for all and celebrated by all. A highlight of Academy life is the all-school musical, which happens each winter and enlists more than 50 students, faculty and staff. The production personifies Hebron's core mission of being a community that welcomes and supports individuality, respects differences, and values each person's contribution.\n\nAthletics: At Hebron the pursuit of academic excellence finds its corollary in the pursuit of athletic excellence, and participation in organized sports forms an integral part of every student’s Hebron experience. The school’s athletic programs are devoted to encouraging a lifelong love of physical activity and an appreciation for teamwork and fair play. For those who prefer not to compete, recreational athletic opportunities are limitless, thanks in large part to the 1,500 acre campus that affords all members of the community an array of outdoor diversions, whether it's skiing, snowshoeing, or just a stroll on the trail. When weather doesn't permit, the recently opened Athletic Center hosts 54,000 square feet of indoor track, basketball and tennis courts, a state-of-the-art workout room, dance studios, and 30-foot rock wall. The structure was erected using environmentally conscious building practices and boasts beautiful and \"green\" architectural details.","dirArts":" Jeanine Eschenbach","dirAthletics":" Guenther","notable":["Hebron is celebrating a 90-year ice hockey legacy","Student artist earned top honors & Gold Key awards","\"Pink\" teams raised $1200+ towards breast cancer"],"collegeSummary":"The College Counseling Office at Hebron Academy provides highly individualized attention to each student throughout the college search and application process.

Our community is culturally diverse, with 145 students from 11 countries and all over the country. Hillside's 150-acre campus, 35 miles west of Boston, provides an ideal setting for boys to excel academically, athletically, creatively and socially.  While we have excellent access to all the city has to offer, most learning takes place in classrooms with a 7:1 student to teacher ratio. \n\nStandards and expectations are the guideposts for success at Hillside School. Our boys learn to embrace the School’s core values of compassion, determination, honesty, respect and fun at Hillside and beyond. These values prepare them for lives of meaning and purpose. Our boys’ efforts in achieving the Hillside core values are measured using our Shades of Blue system. This communication system monitors student progress and behavior, brings attention to areas of concern, and often prevents small issues from escalating. Shades of Blue is essential to Hillside’s effort to keep parents informed of their son’s academic and behavioral success and areas of challenge.\n\nHillside faculty draw upon their deep experience of knowing how boys learn, to meet every student at his individual learning threshold. Academics are thoughtfully designed to accommodate a spectrum of learning styles, from complex and accelerated courses, to programs designed for English as a Second Language students, to coursework that supports bright boys with particular areas of learning difficulty. One key characteristic of Hillside academic life is our shared commitment to teaching boys lifelong learning skills. They master how to take notes, read a text, study, and conduct research -- so that when they graduate, they are genuinely and deeply prepared to tackle the challenges of their future learning. \n\nAthletics promote group cooperation, socialization, self-confidence, school spirit, and play, as well as good physical, mental, and emotional health, all of which are essential to a child’s development.  The Hillside Athletic Program strives to instill sportsmanship, integrity, and effort through student participation. Coaches also emphasize value development.\n\nHillside’s nurturing environment provides the vital support every boy needs to learn and mature. Our graduates emerge as confident, independent learners and valued members of their communities.","dirAdmissions":"Bill Newman","phone":"508-485-2824","admissionsPhone":"508-485-3483","fax":"508-485-4420","email":"admissions@hillsideschool.net","academicSummary":"At Hillside, we know that 150 (commonly known as Dunbar’s Number) “appears to be the maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuine social relationship, the kind where we know who they are and how they relate to us.”  Our School is built upon this principle; our student body always numbers within that range.  Students and their teachers, house parents, and advisors all know each other and have a deep and abiding relationship.  \n\nKnowing the intimacy of Hillside’s size, visitors to campus might be surprised to see the range of facilities, in academics, athletics, activities, and the arts.  Our students are actively encouraged to pursue – or to develop – important skills in such wide-ranging offerings as Mandarin and lacrosse, hockey and rocketry, Computer Media and Peace Education, Leadership and golf, Farm Immersion and Economics.  \n\nSome students come to Hillside already energized by a particular facet of their own imagination.  For others, it is during these pivotal years that they are first exposed to new talents and opportunities.  We believe in the compelling power of passion.  A young man’s passions will undoubtedly evolve over time.  But we are convinced of the lifelong value of developing a capacity for such passion.\n\nClasses rarely number more than 12 and the average student-teacher ratio is 7:1.  We offer small-group tutorials in Organization and Language Arts, Social Skills and Mathematics.  Students learn how to organize not only their belongings, but also their time and thinking.  They acquire note-taking and outlining techniques, and amass clues to effective text analysis.   One unique aspect of Hillside’s tutorial program is that boys attend during their “flex periods;” they don’t miss any academic subjects while they meet.  Specialists work side by side with the boys, examining their learning styles and addressing weaker areas while building on their strengths. Through academic assignments, specialists tailor strategies that will help each boy learn best.  They communicate openly with classroom teachers, so everyone is working together to best support the boys.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Faculty Monica Lucey","campusLifeSummary":"Hillside School provides a structured, supportive, and challenging academic environment for boys in grades five through nine. Boarding and day students enjoy a rich curriculum that also includes a vibrant visual and performing arts program and competitive athletics. The School's unique academic and leadership program, \"Shades of Blue,\" builds character, while holding students accountable to our core values. The cohesiveness of our community is our hallmark. \nClear, consistent standards and expectations are key at Hillside. Our Shades of Blue system rewards students’ exemplary performance, while also identifying areas of concern before they escalate. The system fosters open communication with parents, so they remain aware of their son’s academic and social progress, as well as areas of challenge.\nAdvisor groups serve as “families” within the Hillside community. Mentors work side by side with small clusters of boys throughout the year, as they share in achievements and challenges.  Advisors discuss areas for improvement and praise accomplishments, sharing Shades of Blue evaluations with advisees every two weeks. Students who model core values, such as respect for others, receive our Bulldog of the Week and Bulldog of the Term awards. Community support propels all of our students to reach the highest levels of Shades of Blue and, in doing so, to realize their full potential as students and as individuals.\nHillside’s nurturing environment provides the structure and security that middle school boys need to learn, mature, and to gain a lifelong foundation of compassion and self-esteem. Faculty experienced in meeting each boy at his own level of personal development offer guidance as he navigates the uncertain world of early adolescence.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Craig Evans","studentLifeSummary":"Hillside’s heart is its boarding program, which provides a warm “home away from home” for boys who live on campus either five or seven days a week. Living at Hillside offers students a wealth of opportunities for learning responsibility and cooperation. Many quickly learn that whether their housemates are from Boston or Beijing, they have much to offer each other.  Having many faculty members and administrators live on campus forms a neighborhood in which adults, skilled in interacting with young boys, and in tune with their interests and concerns, are a consistently nurturing presence.\n\nHouse parents awaken their young charges in the morning, making sure they are dressed properly and fulfill their house responsibilities. Student leaders who have been chosen as prefects and proctors also play a vital role in the houses, helping new boys acclimate to life at Hillside and serving as role models.  Proper manners and hygiene receive particular attention, and boys keep their personal space and the common areas clean, out of a sense of shared responsibility and personal pride. Regular “house challenges” include friendly competitive activities, from Foursquare and tennis baseball games, to the “cleanest house” competition. \n\nHillside’s weekend offerings take full advantage of the many enjoyable enrichment activities afforded by the School’s proximity to historic, cultural and sporting amenities in nearby Boston and surrounding towns. Students also have time to relax with friends or enjoy on-campus activities at the Farm, pool, library, fields, or the gym.","artsAthleticsSummary":"At Hillside, athletics and sportsmanship are essential to the development of each student, and a vital part of his character education. Coaches stand steadfast by their players’ sides as they learn important life lessons through sports, from the satisfaction of scoring a goal to the disappointment of a missed play.  The mark of a Hillside athlete is the grace with which he approaches either one.\n\nThe focus of coaching at Hillside is not just to win, but to use athletics as another way to reinforce the School’s core values, as well as encourage structure, motivation and independence. Commitment to a team, giving one’s best effort, and sporting a good attitude when encountering new challenges are as integral to the experience as any literal goals. While boys are required to participate in at least one competitive sport each year, Hillside recognizes that not all boys favor team sports. We also offer non-competitive options each season such as intramurals, Eco Team, skiing, snowboarding, drama, and sailing.\n\nAt Hillside, students are encouraged to take risks, support each other, and make their impression on the world around them. The Visual and Performing Arts curriculum at Hillside gives every boy an outlet for creative expression, teaching him to appreciate the value of diverse cultural influences, but also unique perspectives within his own peer group.\n\nThe Visual Arts program at Hillside inspires students to explore new methods of communication through mediums as varied as cubist painting, throwing pottery, or engineering Pitsco cars.  They learn about the contributions of historical and contemporary artists like Seurat, Picasso, and Goldsworthy by emulating their work and applying their techniques.\nStudents develop their musical knowledge and appreciation through the study of composition and performance.  The Performing Arts curriculum ranges from research projects about the great composers, to students’ own compositions using multimedia software.","dirArts":"  ","dirAthletics":" McCarthy","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"  ","colleges":[{"name":"winchendon school","attending":0}],"alumni":[],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"Hillside School, founded in 1901, is an all-boys boarding school in Marlborough, Massachusetts, serving students from Fifth to Ninth Grades. The School is blessed with 150 acres of pristine land and top-notch facilities that include a pool, 4 Har-tru tennis courts, a track, air-conditioned dormitories, and state-of-the-art classrooms. We pride ourselves on our international student population and specialize in teaching culturally- and linguistically-diverse students. Our summer JumpStart Program, now in its third year, has supported Hillside students as they transition into the academic year. For the first time, we are opening the program to non-Hillside International students.\n\nThe program runs from August 27 to September 7, 2015, at a cost of $4,000 per student. This price includes diagnostic testing and placement in appropriate language classes according to skill level. The student to faculty ratio is 5:1 and our teachers have a combined 30 years of education experience. Our JumpStart Director, Michael Brown, has been teaching ESL and EFL for nearly 20 years, of which 7 were spent in South Korea and Japan.

Hyde was founded to strive to improve the current education system through an alternative approach that places value on an individual’s character and unique potential.\n\nLocated in the quaint and historic shipbuilding city of Bath, Maine, on the Kennebec River, the Hyde School campus was founded in 1966. Formerly the estate of shipbuilder John S. Hyde, the sprawling 145-acre New England estate includes the historic Hyde Mansion and carriage house, which houses classrooms and offices. Other prominent facilities nestled around the estate include the Wheeler Library & Academic Wing, an all-inclusive athletic center with field house, wrestling room, entertainment center, weight and cardio rooms overlooking the 1915 Sunken Garden, Health Center, bookstore, and café, the Student Cultural Center, the Spiritual Center, three playing fields, including a turf field, an all-weather track, indoor tennis and basketball courts, and several dormitories. Year-round, students and faculty enjoy miles of wooded running, bicycling, and cross-country skiing trails that extend beyond the campus.  The campus includes a ropes course with zip line, a 600-acre wilderness facility located in the remote and pristine Bigelow Mountains in Eustis, Maine, running, biking, and cross-country ski trails, state-of-the-art music recording studio, climbing wall, and ice skating ponds.  \n\nAt Hyde, academics are only part of what we teach.  Students get the tools they need to prosper and grow in this challenging world.  That’s because our approach to education is entirely different.  Our teachers focus on helping students reveal their character and develop the confidence they need to succeed in high school, college and beyond.  And the way we teach is different, too.  We offer leadership opportunities to all students as well as a dynamic leadership track for eligible students.  And, unlike any other school, we involve parents and entire school community in the discovery process.  As a result, HYDE students and families often realize their fullest potential and are uniquely prepared to navigate the tough choices they face in everyday life.  Today we serve almost 2,000 students and families in private and public settings.\n\nHYDE.edu","dirAdmissions":"Kristin Harman","phone":"207-443-7101","admissionsPhone":"207-443-7101","fax":"207-442-9346","email":"comevisit@hyde.edu","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Director of Studies Ken Grant","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Richard Truluck","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Art Department Head Jennifer Wilkey","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Jensen","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Lisa Geller","colleges":[{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":4},{"name":"Airzona State University","attending":2},{"name":"Rhodes College","attending":2},{"name":"Bowdoin College","attending":1},{"name":"Purdue University","attending":1}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"Academic Onward, Month of June;\nSummer Challenge, Month of July","dirSummer":"Richard","summerPrograms":[],"meritDescription":"","gallery":[{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo1.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo1.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Be the Best Possible You"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo2.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo2.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Academics at Hyde value both your efforts and your achievements"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo3.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo3.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Every senior gives a speech at Graduation"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo4.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo4.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"SCHOOL SPIRIT!!!"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo5.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo5.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"The Academic Support Program gives students tools to use in their current classes and beyond"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo6.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo6.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"All do all - building community and inner leadership"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo7.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1076/images/Photo7.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Hyde's Summer program brings students to Hyde's wilderness preserve in Eustis, Maine"}],"events":[],"news":[]},{"id":975,"name":"Idyllwild Arts Academy","address":{"full":"P.O.

We’re glad you’re here to see what makes this school and our students special. I hope that as you explore the possibility of becoming part of Springs, you will be excited by what is happening here, and by what you discover about yourself and your potential through this process.\n\nOur boarding and day program brings together a diverse and vibrant cohort of just over 300 students in the 8th-12th grades, on a 350-acre campus where nature serves as both inspiration and laboratory. Students and faculty work together in a model of shared governance, and students discover their passions by taking part in everything from athletics to our renowned choir to student-run scholastic, service, and special-interest clubs.\n \nNearly all of our faculty members have advanced degrees, and have chosen to teach and mentor young people. Our beautiful, cutting-edge classrooms and innovative independent study options all enhance the great teaching that opens doors to new ideas and new possibilities. While our students are prepared for college, and each year go to some of the finest colleges and universities in the country and in the world, Indian Springs is so much more: We are a life preparatory school.\n \nInspired our motto: “Learning through Living.”  The school’s founding impulse also stems from a connective, expansive vision of American society and democracy. Our mission is to develop in students a love of learning, a sense of integrity and moral courage, and an ethic of participatory citizenship. Springs aims to connect, value, and include young people whose origins, identities, beliefs, and experiences reflect the rich and instructive diversity of our global society.  That means learning at Springs is both an individual pursuit and a collective endeavor, in which we deeply understand our world and one another. \n \nIndian Springs exists far beyond our striking campus; it is a passionate extended community of alumni, parents, and friends that spans the globe and generations. So many people have had their lives changed for the better by Springs. I hope you too can begin to imagine how you might be transformed by, and contribute to, our extraordinary community of learners.","dirAdmissions":"Claire Cassady","phone":"205-988-3350","admissionsPhone":"205-332-0561","fax":"205-988-3797","email":"admission@indiansprings.org","academicSummary":"Indian Springs School is nationally and internationally known for its academic excellence. Based on our motto “Learning Through Living,” our unique school environment fosters academic excellence, participatory citizenship, independent thinking and self-advocacy in our students.  Our graduates possess the skills, knowledge and personal strengths that enable them to gain acceptance and excel at the finest colleges and universities.   Our unique community design enables students to be active participants in all aspects of the school’s operations and provides them the opportunity to make a substantive difference in the school and in the world.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Academics Tanya Hyatt","campusLifeSummary":"Indian Springs School has a 350-acre campus in a valley surrounded by the most southwestern hills of the Appalachian Mountains. Among the hickory, oak, maple, and sweetgum trees that reflect the changing seasons, there are trails for hiking, biking and cross-country running. The spring-fed lake provides for canoeing and swimming and sunning on the sandy beach. Sharing our southern boundary is Oak Mountain State Park, with thousands of wooded acres and rock faces for climbing.\n\nOur campus runs like a small town. Each semester the students elect a Mayor to head the Student Government and work with the faculty in the day-to-day operation of the school. Students at Indian Springs get involved in all sorts of activities that go far beyond learning in the classroom. We are a small school, but the possibilities for participation are huge. Often students take the initiative in starting up a new club, sport or community service project. In weekly town meetings we share ideas and report on all that is going on.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Student Development and Community Life Janae Peters","studentLifeSummary":"There is a clear structure to each day at Indian Springs School, but students don't feel \"programmed.\" Students work with an advisor to select courses that are right for them. There are tons of extra-curricular activities, and students are welcome to try any or all of them … or to start a new one. Students work hard, but also know that it is okay to take a break and simply relax. In such an environment students get to know others -- and themselves -- better. In addition, close relationships form between students and faculty … and their spouses and children. A senior who was about to graduate last year wrote the following, \"Had I not attended Indian Springs, I don't know if I would have come out of my shell. I don't know what other school has such a close student-teacher relationship. Going to a teacher's house for dinner, sharing a birthday celebration, talking in the commons room, or watching a soccer game together. I love this school and everyone affiliated with it.\" At Indian Springs School, students will also meet peers from around the corner and around the world. Diversity is celebrated, and cliques are uncool. The school is always open, and you'll find day students coming to campus on the weekends to be with boarders, participate in activities and just hang out. The friendships that are formed here are the ones that last.","artsAthleticsSummary":"While the athletics program at Springs has won state championships in sports including tennis and soccer, the school is most proud of the way in which athletics helps students develop as people and citizens of the school community. In addition to Alabama High School Athletic Association-sanctioned sports, the school offers opportunities for students to take part in non-traditional sports such as fencing and ultimate frisbee. Another important of the school community is the arts, with offerings in music, theater and the visual arts. About  40% of the student body takes part in the school's choir, and the school's chamber choir tours internationally. The theater program takes on three productions per year, and strong visual arts and instrumental music programs round out arts offerings.","dirArts":"Art Department Clay Colvin","dirAthletics":"Art Department Chair Van Horn","notable":["2008 & 2014 Boys Soccer State Champions","2008 Girls Soccer State Runner Up","2006 Tennis State Champions"],"collegeSummary":"Indian Springs has a long history of helping our students find, evaluate, and successfully apply to great colleges and universities. Take a look at our college placement results, and you will discover what our graduates fully understand: Indian Springs strives to help each student find the match that best suits his or her needs.\nThe formal College Advising process begins in the Junior year. This is a time of self-exploration. We encourage students to approach this discovery phase as young adults, to discover their passions, interests and talents, and to build upon their strengths and develop new ones. Parents are also actively engaged in the process.\nThe Senior year distills a student’s abilities and college desires into a manageable list. Applications are completed, essays are written, teachers are asked for letters of recommendation, and final visitations are made. All along the way, our College Advising Office is actively supporting (and prodding) our students, even past the point where they sign the letter of intent. It marks the end of one journey, and the beginning of another.","dirCollege":"Director of College Advising Amelia Johnson","colleges":[{"name":"The University of Alabama","attending":29},{"name":"Emory University","attending":11},{"name":"Georgia Institute of Techonology","attending":8},{"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","attending":6},{"name":"George Washington University","attending":5},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":4},{"name":"Northwestern University","attending":4},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","attending":4},{"name":"Dartmouth College","attending":3},{"name":"Wellesley College","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"C.

in 1928 and located in downtown Bangor, Maine, John Bapst is a community of talented students and dedicated teachers. Students prepare for top colleges in Maine and across the US by challenging themselves academically and joining in the life of the school. Technology, sports, drama, instrumental and vocal music, visual arts, community service, and clubs -- all are major parts of the student experience. In 2016, students took 510 AP exams, with 80% scoring 3 or above.\n\nThe attractive, safe city of Bangor, with a population of 33,000 and home to Bangor International Airport, is an hour's drive from the Maine coast, affording access to some of America's most beautiful scenery. Day students (430) come from a wide area; boarding students come from China (42), Vietnam (13), South Korea (11), Germany (4), Japan (2), and Spain (1) and live on campus in small dorms or in local homestays. John Bapst graduates are currently studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, Berklee College of Music, Boston College, Boston University, Bowdoin, Carnegie Mellon, Case Western, Colby, Columbia, Dartmouth, Duke, Georgia Tech, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan State, NYU, Notre Dame, Parsons, Penn, Purdue, Stanford, UC-Irvine, UC-San Diego, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin, Yale, and many more fine colleges and universities. In Maine, many John Bapst graduates have entered the honors programs of the University of Maine, earning scholarships in engineering and other fields. Others attend programs at Husson University, Maine Maritime, and elsewhere.\n\nJohn Bapst is medium-sized school with the friendly, student-centered atmosphere of a small school. Teachers care deeply about students, and students care about each other and eagerly serve the community. \n\nThe school accepts students from diverse educational and personal backgrounds and at all four high school grade levels. The John Bapst approach – high expectations, outstanding teaching, student involvement, and a caring community – is its formula for meaningful academic and personal growth.","dirAdmissions":"Beth Campbell","phone":"207-947-0313","admissionsPhone":"207-947-0313 ext.108","fax":"207-947-7694","email":"bcampbell@johnbapst.org","academicSummary":"John Bapst is focused on its college-prep mission. 100% of its graduates follow a demanding curriculum designed to prepare students to read, think, and write at a high level. The school's strengths in English, math, and science are evident in that most students take AP courses in these areas. As an international community, the social sciences broaden students' exposure to history (American, European, and world), economics, the contemporary world (AP Human Geography, anthropology, sociology), and politics. Four languages are offered: Chinese, French, Spanish, Latin. ESL support is available to international students at no extra charge. The school also excels in music and art. Bangor is a small, safe city in one of America's most beautiful states.","dirAcademics":"Principal David Armistead","campusLifeSummary":"The school's small boarding program (the largest of 7 dorm houses just 16 students)offers a friendly, supportive environment for academic and personal growth.

In music, classical and contemporary music groups thrive; there are more than 100 students in the Concert Band. In visual arts, two outstanding teachers prep students for strong art school programs each year\n\nThe school's interscholastic sports program appeals to many students who do multiple sports. Fall sports include field hockey, football, golf, cross-country, and soccer. Winter sports are skiing, ice hockey, basketball, indoor track, and swimming. In spring it's time for tennis, baseball, softball, and outdoor track.","dirArts":"Director of Fine and Performing Arts Melissa Burns","dirAthletics":"Director of Fine and Performing Arts

Basically, it is one of the most beautiful settings you might find anywhere in the world.\n\nBut, more important than the natural beauty of our surroundings, is the close-knit nature of our community. All of the academic, athletic and arts facilities share a single square mile of campus. This makes getting from class to class much easier as you work through your daily schedule. It makes it simple to get to your job, or to lunch, and a breeze to participate in your clubs. And the town of Kent is just a five-minute walk away.\n\nYou’ll find that working, studying and living in such a stunning location, surrounded by such amazing friends and faculty to be a transforming experience.  In fact, you’ll find your spiritual life and community service to be vital parts of the Kent experience. Or maybe it’s life experience. Because as you learn and grow, get ready for college and become a leader, you’ll see how important humanity is. When you leave Kent and look back on your experience, the thing you’ll remember most—more than the challenging classes and action-packed weekends is the people you met, how well you knew them, and how well they knew and supported you, and the fun you had together.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Cathe Mazza","studentLifeSummary":"Living at Kent is one of the best parts of learning at Kent. Surrounded by your friends and supported by your teachers, you discover how to define your own space… and share it. You learn how to always be there for a buddy, as well as how to navigate the world (and the ins and outs of Kent) for yourself. In fact, faculty members and their families live in every dorm, so you’ll always have “dorm parents” looking out for you (and yes, math tips in your pajamas are entirely possible!)\n\nIn the beginning, you’ll be matched with a roommate—maybe from as far away as South Africa, the Ukraine or Thailand. (Everybody’s impressed with how many international students choose Kent.) After your first semester you can switch if you want. You’ll have internet access in your room.  Every dorm has a common room area with couches, TV, DVD, and a microwave. Some common rooms have table tennis and pool tables too.\n\nAnd you’ll always feel safe. The dorms are locked at night with Safety Officers on duty through the evening and night. If you ever have any problems, the Dorm Faculty, Dorm Head and Dorm Prefects are always there to help you out. And if you get sick, there’s a campus nurse on duty 24/7 and a doctor on-campus or on call.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Head of Art Department Jenna Lynch","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Marble","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Our college counseling process is a natural extension of Kent’s educational philosophy, emphasizing independent thinking, introspection, personal responsibility, leadership and informed decision making. We believe that the college search process should be student centered, supportive and also fun — a celebration of each student’s past accomplishments and promise for the future. College represents an important milestone in a student’s life. It is a time for individuation, for students to further develop their interests, explore and define their talents, and deepen their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFrom the moment a student steps foot on the Kent campus, he or she is preparing for college. Every student at Kent follows a college preparatory curriculum, each one personally crafted for the abilities of the individual student. Each year, students meet with their advisors and the Director of Studies to discuss their course selection. Students also participate in the Third and Fourth Form seminars which help students develop excellent study skills and mark their path to college. Throughout their Kent career, students are encouraged to understand that successful college preparation depends on engaging fully in the Kent School experience, both in and out of the classroom.\n\nThe formal college counseling process begins in the Winter Term of the Fifth Form year. Our team of five college counselors stands ready to guide and support Kent students as they examine their interests, explore their passions, and embark on the next stage of their academic journey.  Just as each student’s academic program is uniquely molded to challenge each individual, so is the college process unique to each student. It is the mission of the College Counseling Office to guide and support student and their families through the college search and application process, and ultimately to identify the best college matches for each individual.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Shawn Rousseau","colleges":[{"name":"New York Univeristy","attending":15},{"name":"George Washington University","attending":14},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":12},{"name":"Colby College","attending":11},{"name":"University of California at Berkeley","attending":10},{"name":"Connecticut College","attending":8},{"name":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","attending":8},{"name":"United States Naval Academy","attending":8},{"name":"Boston University","attending":7},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":7}],"alumni":[],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"SEEK Program: This past summer, Kent School offered four programs designed to give high school students, including those who will be beginning ninth grade, the chance to experience engineering education and entrepreneurship. The Summer Educational Experience at Kent (SEEK) was offered in partnerships with professionals from several institutions including U. Penn’s Wharton Business School, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Georgia Tech Integrated Product Lifecycle Engineering (IPLE) Laboratory.                         Kent Expeditions: a unique experience offering students the opportunity to participate firsthand in the worlds's culture outside of the classroom walls. Offerings include a Marine Sciences trip which gives students and faculty alike the opportunity to explore the oceans with research scientists, visit mangrove forests, work with dolphins and rays, sample the planktonic community, observe sea turtles, and pursue hands-on activities with the Institute’s deep sea engineering programs. Global Expeditions offers a small group of students a chance to broaden their knowledge of an interdisciplinary topic through the combination of a spring seminar followed by a trip shortly after Prize Day weekend.  Whether it’s French films, Spanish architecture, Italian cuisine, or European history, they will have a chance to go beyond the classroom with Kent faculty who are passionate about their subject.  After getting to know each other and the topic over the course of 8 sessions in the spring term, students and chaperones will travel to the host country for approximately a week, where they will experience first-hand the things they’ve learned about.  Students will be selected by application, and the group will be limited to 8-10 participants.  No prior study of the language of the host country is required, just an interest in travel and culture.","dirSummer":"","summerPrograms":[],"meritDescription":"","gallery":[{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1002/images/Photo1.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1002/images/Photo1.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":""}],"events":[{"name":"Open House","type":"Open House","start":"2016-09-24T09:30:00.000Z","end":"2016-09-24T13:00:00.000Z","location":"Kent School","description":"","link":""}],"news":[]},{"id":1038,"name":"Kents Hill School","address":{"full":"P.O.

Kimball Union's location and its proximity to Dartmouth College make it the preferred choice for students seeking an educational experience that integrates a traditional preparatory curriculum with innovative programs and cutting-edge technology. Kimball Union balances a challenging, dynamic curriculum with excellent programs in both athletics and the arts.\n\nLocated in Meriden, New Hampshire, the Academy's 1,300-acre rural campus is two hours from Boston, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut.

For instance, Laura never knew that she wanted to study biology, but after her sophomore year at Kimball Union, she fell for its fascinating and complex nature. We open doors to new possibilities by exposing our students to many different disciplines. It’s a wonderful way for them to become inspired, to really find out what they want to accomplish with their education.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Michael Porrazzo","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Brook Raney","studentLifeSummary":"Kimball Union Academy offers an open and safe community dedicated to stimulating intellectual curiosity while stewarding emotional and spiritual growth.

We celebrate and honor the diversity of achievements, interests, aspirations, and backgrounds our students represent, and as such we work tirelessly to support our students’ applications to a wide variety of colleges and universities.\n\nOur goal is to help students find a group of colleges that meets their individual needs — academic, social, athletic or artistic. We try to help students to find colleges that best fit them, not merely those that have the highest “name recognition.” A “great school” is first and foremost a “great match.”\n\nWe invite students and parents to take full advantage of the abundant resources offered by KUA’s College Advising Office, working together to identify these “great matches.” While the search is a collaborative process, ultimately it is the student who will be going to college. To that end, we expect and empower each student to be the leader in this process and to take initiative. Each student will own his or her process from start to finish.","dirCollege":"Director of College Advising Derek Gueldenzoph","colleges":[{"name":"Boston University","attending":11},{"name":"Connecticut College","attending":8},{"name":"Skidmore College","attending":8},{"name":"Bates College","attending":7},{"name":"Colby College","attending":7},{"name":"New York University","attending":7},{"name":"Brandeis University","attending":6},{"name":"Boston College","attending":5},{"name":"Dartmouth College","attending":5},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":5},{"name":"University of California at Berkeley","attending":5},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":4},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":4},{"name":"Kenyon College","attending":3},{"name":"Middlebury College","attending":3},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":2},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","attending":2},{"name":"Lehigh University","attending":2},{"name":"Princeton University","attending":1},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":1}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"","dirSummer":"","summerPrograms":[],"meritDescription":"","gallery":[{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo1.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo1.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Campus"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo2.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo2.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Advisor Group"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo3.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo3.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Quad"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo4.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo4.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Fans"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo5.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo5.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Sweeney Todd"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo6.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo6.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Field Hockey"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo7.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo7.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Lower Campus"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo8.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo8.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Campus In Winter"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo9.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo9.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"The Hilltop"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo10.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/877/images/Photo10.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Campus Center"}],"events":[{"name":"Admission Open House","type":"Open House","start":"2016-10-22T09:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-10-22T13:00:00.000Z","location":"Barrette Campus Center","description":"Learn about our academic program, tour the campus with current students and interact with our exceptional faculty.

development of character and citizenship.\n\nDistinguished by its diverse student body, LFA prepares students with the intellectual, cultural, and interpersonal skills necessary to succeed in the global community.","dirAdmissions":"Carolyn Gorowski","phone":"847-234-3210","admissionsPhone":"847-615-3267","fax":"847-295-8149","email":"admissions@lfanet.org","academicSummary":"The entire Lake Forest Academy curriculum is designed to be a challenging preparation for college, and all courses are taught at what would typically be considered “honors” level at most schools. All courses are taught at a level that will prepare students for the challenges of work in Advanced Placement courses. Academic expectations of students are high from freshman through senior years.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Bill Dolbee","campusLifeSummary":"Over 200 of LFA's 435 students live on campus in one of five dormitories that range in size from 10 to 72 students.   These boarding students come from all over Illinois, all over the U.S., and all over the world.  \n\nIf you're a boarding student, your dorm is more than just where you study and sleep -  it's your home away from home, a place to hang out with friends, play Foosball, watch movies or sporting events on the common room television, chat with teachers, or just have fun!\n\nEach dorm is staffed by a team of resident faculty members, many of whom live in apartments attached to the dormitories.  These faculty members supervise evening study hours, sponsor weekend trips and activities, and are on hand whenever students need assistance.  Each dorm also has a team of student proctors who help our boarders with everything from checking in at curfew to managing study time effectively.  \nEach weekend, LFA offers a wide range of trips, activities, and other events for our boarders.  Some of the most popular weekend activities include: home sporting events; van runs to local shopping malls; trips to downtown Chicago (the Art Institute, Chinatown, Michigan Avenue shopping); cooking, cookie baking, roll-your-own sushi, and pasta making in faculty homes; late-night breakfast runs to local diners; van runs to local restaurants, movie theaters, mini golf, and bowling alleys; watching movie marathons or sports playoff games in dorm commons.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Dean of Students-Director of Residential Jon Freeman","studentLifeSummary":"As a Caxy you will be representing Lake Forest Academy, where character, history, scholarship, school spirit, citizenship and responsibility are promoted so you will have the necessary skills to face your future with strength and confidence.\n\nWhen you are a Caxy you can live on or off campus.\n\nAs a boarding student you will live in one of the five single-sex dormitories on campus. Each dorm has resident faculty members either living within or assigned to a specific dorm.\n\nIf you are day student chances are you will be spending most of your time on campus, so please know that you are encouraged to eat all three of your meals in the dining hall and take advantage of all our school sponsored weekend activities.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Our athletic program offers many athletic opportunities, ranging from preparing for collegiate athletics to physical fitness and individual development. The essence of our program is the promotion of sportsmanship. Whether it be varsity athletics, intramurals, physical education, or general recreation, we honor participation, achievement and effort.\n\nWe strive to find success, measured not only in victories, but also in the individual development of each athlete.\n\nWe take pride in the diversity of our student athletes and promote the value of lifelong physical fitness. Our coaches consistently challenge our student-athletes to reach their potential. We seek excellence in both athletics and academics. Our scholar athletes are a part of a mission-centered athletic tradition. We believe that the skills that our student-athletes develop during their time at the Academy will mold them into productive members of society. \n\n\nAt Lake Forest Academy the Fine Arts are an integral part of all disciplines, emphasizing creative thinking and self expression as essential components of one’s overall academic experience. Within our courses students will: 1) Obtain the necessary skills to produce work that is reflective of themselves and of the environment around them. 2) Gain an appreciation for art and recognize its place in historical and cultural context. 3) Build their aptitude in analysis and interpretation as a means of making more informed aesthetic judgments. 4) Develop their capacity for artistic exploration and divergent thought processes which can be reflected and applied in all aspects of life.","dirArts":" Monica Palmer","dirAthletics":" Madeley","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"A significant element to our school mission is to prepare students for college and a global work environment. College Counseling at Lake Forest Academy is a comprehensive endeavor that spans from freshman to senior year. \n\nThe college search is different for every student, so college counselors begin meeting with students individually during their junior year. The four person counseling staff offers a small student-to-counselor ratio, a big advantage in creating a meaningful and individualized college search for each student. Each counselor is an active member of the LFA community who understands the importance of seeing student growth in all aspects of campus life. \n\nUltimately, we believe students and parents trust LFA's college counselors for their professional perspective and skills, as well as their honesty, accessibility, and overall understanding of the many variables that can impact college admission decisions.","dirCollege":"Dean of College Counseling Andrew Poska","colleges":[{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","attending":29},{"name":"New York University","attending":14},{"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","attending":11},{"name":"Emory University","attending":9},{"name":"Boston University","attending":9},{"name":"Colorado College","attending":9},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","attending":8},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":8},{"name":"Northwestern University","attending":7},{"name":"University of Pennyslvania","attending":7},{"name":"Furman University","attending":7},{"name":"University of Michigan","attending":7},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":7},{"name":"The George Washington University","attending":7},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":6},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","attending":6},{"name":"Indiana University at Bloomington","attending":6},{"name":"University of Chicago","attending":6}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"LFA provides a wide selection of summer programs each year.\n\nThere are many exciting programs offered, and you have the choice of spending the day on the LFA campus or experiencing living on campus for the summer while you learn and explore.\n\nWe offer an intensive English as a Second Language (ESL) program, which prepares students to study in English speaking environments.

One hundred percent of last year's graduating class was accepted at university, and 80 percent was accepted by the university of their choice. University expectations of student achievement continue to rise. This is a product both of the increasing competition for university places and of the increasing breadth and complexity of knowledge which universities must impart to their students.\n\nIn order to prepare students well for the challenges of university and a rapidly changing world, Lakefield's faculty engage students in academic activities which will enable them to develop disciplined habits of study, critical thinking skills, and a talent for co-operative problem-solving. In addition, students are given significant opportunities to use modern technology as a tool to assist them in their learning.

Our students develop skills and gain knowledge with the understanding that their intelligence is not fixed. We expect students to become persistent problem-solvers by gaining an understanding of content and thinking creatively about what they examine. We ask students to discover what inspires them and to exploit those interests on behalf of others.\n\nOur students and their teachers live and learn together in an environment characterized by what John Dewey called a both/and paradigm in which students are expected to think things together rather than apart. The faculty at Lawrence Academy design curriculum and implement pedagogy with the intent of helping students mature into confident, self-aware, problem solvers who experience education as a means for realizing their individual potential as responsible citizens with the capacity to positively impact others and the environment.","dirAcademics":"Director Arthur Karp","campusLifeSummary":"Step onto Lawrence Academy's campus, and it will not take you long to see and feel what makes our school different. Yes, you will be warmly welcomed; that is our way. But more importantly, from your first visit to your departure following graduation, you are respected for who you are and who you can become. It is a school that values and emphasizes integrity, trust, self-respect, and concern for the community as a whole.\n\nLawrence Academy stands out for its many opportunities—to develop in depth a special talent or skill, to discover and use your leadership abilities, and to take advantage of the school's cultural and social diversity. We provide the challenges and the support that encourage you to take constructive risks and to build self-confidence while contributing to the school community in ways you may never have imagined.\n\nBrowsing our website (www.lacademy.edu) will introduce you to more details of life on our boarding school's campus. It would be a tall order to fill, however, to capture on a website what life on our campus would be for you. If what you see interests you, then it's time to come take a look around for yourself.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Libby Margraf","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"We are passionate about the arts at Lawrence Academy.

His founding mission statement lives on to this day: to find the promise in each student.\n\nMiddlesex students come from 30 states and 20 countries and pursue academic excellence in small classes that challenge their intellects and imaginations. Extraordinary facilities support superb, inclusive programs in arts and athletics.

Seventy-five percent of rooms on campus are singles. Two to three faculty families live in every Middlesex house. The formal and informal interactions in the houses between students, faculty and families create an environment that promotes close personal relationships and balanced lives.  Beyond the dormitories, the academic facilities, and the athletic center, the simple, dignified chapel provides the campus its stately center and a community meeting place.

Each year, the School updates its College Placement Manual and seeks to provide a maximum level of assistance to our students and their parents.  This assistance also includes the coordination of both on-campus visits from college representatives and off-campus trips that give both day and boarding students the opportunity to attend open houses and discovery days at colleges throughout Virginia.   All members of the Class of 2011 were accepted into nationally recognized universities, with 50%  accepted at top 50 National Universities.","dirCollege":"Director of College Placement Hugh

Academy, engages faculty and students in intense and challenging preparation for college and for life, in an environment that stimulates and supports extraordinary intellectual and personal growth. Day in and day out, in and out of class, faculty connect vitally with students – setting sights high, bringing opportunities to light, tackling big questions, affirming students’ individuality, and building their confidence and skill. Not only do they succeed at the most competitive universities in the country, Milton graduates' awareness, creativity and competence empower them to fully commit themselves to meaningful endeavors of all kinds, throughout the world.  Milton Academy is located just eight miles south of Boston.","dirAdmissions":"Paul Rebuck","phone":"617-898-1798","admissionsPhone":"617-898-2227","fax":"617-898-1701","email":"admissions@milton.edu","academicSummary":"For more than 200 years, Milton has developed confident, independent thinkers in an intimate, friendly setting where students and faculty members understand that the life of the mind is the pulse of the School. A gifted and dedicated faculty motivates a diverse student body, providing students with the structure to learn and the support to take risks. The faculty’s teaching expertise and passion for scholarship generates extraordinary growth in students who learn to expect the most of themselves. The Milton community connects purposefully with world issues. Students graduate with a clear sense of themselves, their world, and how to contribute.\n\nBeing smart and interested at Milton is easy, fun and normal. Classrooms have about 14 students, and learning is discussion based, not lecture based. Faculty give your work thorough commentary and respectful responses. They look for analysis, critical thinking, and skill in expressing ideas. You are likely to find new areas of study that fascinate and inspire you. APs are not the only advanced course work. A wealth of courses allows you to take your study as far as you wish. Faculty know you well, want you to succeed, help you outside of class, and challenge you to meet higher expectations.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Jackie Bonenfant","campusLifeSummary":"Students live with seasoned faculty “parents” in eight, single-sex residential houses of varying sizes (no larger than 48 students). Milton houses include all four classes: living with older and younger “siblings” ensures role models, support, a sense of affection and belonging. Students enjoy “sit down” dinners with faculty and their families three times each week. House heads set a stable, nurturing tone, and students’ faculty advisors live in or are affiliated with the house. Students say they gain “responsibility, independence, confidence, and extraordinary friendships with people their own age as well as adults.”","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Bridget Johnson","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"At Milton, you do not have to choose whether you want to be an intellectual, a musician, an athlete, a performer or an artist. You can be all of these; one of the best things about Milton is that there is no limit to the way you define your identity.\n\nTop-notch athletics are a Milton tradition. Milton is a member of the Independent School League (ISL). Interscholastic teams (15 each for boys and girls at numerous levels)compete against Andover, Groton, St. Paul’s, and Noble & Greenough, among others. The Athletic and Convocation Center, with basketball courts, an indoor track, a fitness center and an ice rink, adds to outdoor fields and courts. Intramural offerings extend opportunities for play and skill-development.\n\nArt thrives at Milton: extraordinary facilities; talented students; faculty who are also artists and performers; a campus culture that promotes the arts. All students fulfill a one-year arts requirement. Favorite weekend activities are viewing friends’ exhibited work and watching friends perform—in the jazz combo, in one of 10 annual theatrical productions, in dance, in one of eight singing groups, at speech team galas.","dirArts":"Director of Visual Arts Ian Torney","dirAthletics":"Director of Visual Arts Reddicks","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Milton’s faculty, curriculum, small class sizes and interactive teaching structure, provides rigorous preparation for college.

in 1843, Porter’s excels at preparing young women for college, for leadership and for life. A boarding and day school for students in grades nine through 12, Porter’s offers a challenging academic curriculum and a diverse residential community of scholars, athletes, artists and friends. With over 300 students hailing from 27 states and representing 16 countries, Porter’s dynamic approach to education inspires young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens.\n\nPorter’s mission statement sets high expectations: “We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.” Students enthusiastically accept this challenge with the assistance of faculty members who serve as educators, advisers, coaches and mentors. At Porter's, young women develop high levels of achievement in mathematics, foreign languages, science, history, English, and the arts by being challenged to think independently, ask questions, debate theories and share ideas. Porter’s rigorous academic program, collaborative environment and supportive community prepares students for college and beyond.\n\nPorter’s believes in maintaining a healthy balance between intellectual activity and physical exercise; each student participates daily on a team, in the dance program, or in a sports class.  Interscholastic sports are badminton, basketball, crew, cross-country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, skiing, squash, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, Ultimate Frisbee, and volleyball. An extensive number of playing fields and seven DecoTurf tennis courts are available, including three turf fields opening in September 2015. An athletics/recreation center contains two gyms, an indoor track, a climbing wall, a fitness center, and basketball and volleyball courts. An additional athletic facility with an eight-lane pool and eight international squash courts opened in September 2007. A new boathouse for crew sits on the Farmington River.

The spectacular North Country School campus is in the Adirondack Mountains near Lake Placid, NY, a popular resort destination and site of two Winter Olympic Games. \n\nOur 200-acre campus features a working farm, extensive gardens, and alpine wilderness that provide hands-on opportunities for learning and growth. Here boys and girls in grades 4-9 benefit from a literal and metaphorical breath of fresh air; our children thrive in a carefully paced program that features equal parts academics, arts, work, and play. The guidance of talented, committed adults and a strong, diverse community instill in students values of simple living and environmental responsibility. With a unique mix of inspiring people, place, and programs, North Country School helps students flourish.\n\nAt NCS, 95% of ninth graders are accepted to their first or second choice secondary schools.  The Secondary School Placement Program advisors assist students and their families in selecting appropriate schools for grades 10-12 and guide students through the application process.   Students receive coaching in SSAT test-taking strategies, application essay writing and interview skills.  Additionally, the school hosts admissions representatives from secondary schools throughout the year.","dirAdmissions":"David Damico","phone":"518-523-9329","admissionsPhone":"518-523-9329 ext.6000","fax":"518-523-4858","email":"admissions@northcountryschool.org","academicSummary":"Our traditional core curriculum, enriched by hands-on projects and activities, focuses on the acquisition of solid academic skills. Small classes allow for attention and instruction that challenge each child according to his or her ability. We have high expectations for our students.\n\nNCS founder Walter Clark wrote, “This whole school was built on this thought: children need direct experience if they are to grow and learn most effectively.” Years later, our focus on direct experience remains at the heart of our program. Children learn by doing, and they grow by exploring new things, all with the guidance of caring, creative adults.\n\nIn our academic program, the emphasis on experiential learning is evident in hands-on projects and lessons that focus on our location. In North Country School classes, math students learn about measurement and acquire new computer skills when they record and track the weights of newborn lambs in the barnyard. Science students study anatomy by reassembling chicken skeletons using bones from birds they harvested in the fall.  Students learn the physical properties of snow pack during a winter term unit on avalanches. In English class, students write persuasive letters to elected officials about current issues they have researched; they create hand-bound, hard-cover journals of their writing and artwork. In arts electives, students paint barn murals, renovate a rowboat in disrepair, or dye wool from our sheep to use in knitting and felting projects.\n\nTo help students acquire the basic and advanced skills they need in all core academic disciplines, NCS teachers employ a mix of instructional strategies. From collaborative group work to lectures to hands-on labs and projects, students experience innovative teaching strategies on a daily basis. A variety of support services is also available to meet students’ needs.\n\nFinally, North Country School embraces the use of computer technology as a critical learning tool.  Homework and other class projects are posted on NCS' Google Apps platform, facilitating student-teacher communication.  The computer lab is equipped with modern video and photo editing software.  While NCS keeps current with technological advances, the school takes pride in a judicious use of technology in order to minimize students' unproductive computer time.","dirAcademics":"Assistant Head Anne Swayze","campusLifeSummary":"Students at NCS live with a roommate in one of six small houses of 8-12 children.  A team of faculty houseparents works carefully to support and supervise each child.  Sharing living spaces and the daily routines of morning wake-up, evening study hall, and bedtime creates strong relationships among the children and adults in the house.  The house becomes the place for much of each student's learning and growth.  \"Home nights\" every Wednesday - when each house prepares and eats dinner together and enjoys special activities - help students feel a sense of family and a \"home away from home.\"","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Luke Hudak","studentLifeSummary":"Learning at NCS takes place not just in the classroom.  Helping a younger housemate with math homework; packing for a weekend overnight; enjoying a Wednesday \"home night\" activity with housemates: these are the opportunities for recreation and sharing that round out the North Country School experience.\n\nA full weekday schedule, close-knit house life and a robust weekend program provide students with enriching experiences and help build the strong community that gives every child the vital sense that he or she belongs.\n\nBalancing academics, arts, work and play includes making time for physical activity, socializing with friends and quiet or alone time for reading and music.  We do not view students as small adults; our children need and deserve time for fun, play and invention.","artsAthleticsSummary":"ARTS:\n\n“Art every day” are words we live by at North Country School.\n\nFor a school our size, we have an unusually large group of arts teachers (more than one-third of the faculty teaches an arts class) and an impressive array of course listings. All students have the equivalent of at least one art class every day, with younger students rotating through core classes in music, theatre, painting and drawing, ceramics, fiber arts, photography, and woodshop. Eighth and ninth graders choose from electives that provide opportunities for advanced mastery of core arts, as well as exposure to new offerings that range from documentary filmmaking to wooden boat restoration or metal shop. Students of all ages have opportunities to submit their work to juried art shows sponsored by local arts organizations.\n\nIntersession is a week in February that is dedicated to arts and crafts, and the annual spring play is a decades-old tradition that involves nearly everyone on campus. Every year the production features original sets, music, effects, and costuming that are remarkable for both their creativity and sustainability—most staging and costuming are made from recycled materials.\n\nOUTDOORS AND ATHLETICS: Taking full advantage of our spectacular mountain setting, the Outdoor Program offerings range from a walk in the woods to ambitious multi-day hiking and backpacking trips.  We offer team sports: soccer, basketball, cross-country skiing and ultimate frisbee, as well as a riding program with ten horses, two riding rings and miles of mountain trails.  In the winter months, we have extensive snow sport offerings: skiing and snowboarding on our own ski hill and at Whiteface Mountain, Nordic skiing, skating, and ice climbing.  The outdoor program encourages students to take risks, acquire new skills, and gain confidence.  All gear, except for personal clothing, is provided so that all children have the opportunity to participate in all offerings.","dirArts":"Teacher Sierra Grennan","dirAthletics":"Teacher Robjent","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"At NCS, 95 percent of ninth graders are accepted to their first- or second-choice school.

Mount Hermon (NMH) is an independent coeducational boarding and day school for 650 students in grades 9–12 and a postgraduate year. NMH’s mission is to provide an exceptional, well-grounded education for the “head, heart, and hand” of each student.\n \nNMH balances academic excellence and a challenging, innovative college-preparatory curriculum with extensive opportunities in international studies, athletics, the arts, and service work. Supported and guided by expert faculty and staff, students are encouraged to pursue their passions and discover new ones, and to make their own unique contribution to the NMH community.\n\nNMH’s mission is to encourage students to think critically, act with humanity, and discover within themselves a sense of purpose. To that end, our faculty devote an extraordinary amount of time and energy to fostering students’ accomplishment and success, both in and out of the classroom.\n\nOur distinctive “College Model Academic Program” (CMAP) is centered around class periods that are longer than a typical high school class (80 min.). This allows students to explore subjects in greater depth and spend more time with their teachers. Students take three major courses each semester — six per year, which is one more that at schools that have traditional schedules. The average class size is 11 students, and NMH’s overall student–teacher ratio is 6 to 1.\n\nNMH combines academic demands with a commitment to life balance. We focus on the whole student, and aim to be flexible in meeting individual needs while also integrating students into a diverse, busy community. Our “Partnership of 12” initiative is a network of adults (at least a dozen every semester) who support each student every day, including teachers, coaches, dorm staff, and work supervisors. \n\nNMH has made serious commitments to multiculturalism throughout its 136-year history. Currently, 25 percent of the student body is international, and the school focuses extensively on racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, religious, and gender diversity in extracurricular workshops and events throughout the year. \n\nNMH has no preconceived notion of who students ought to be, but great expectations of what they can be. At NMH, students are academically challenged, socially engaged, and constantly surprised by both themselves and the world.","dirAdmissions":"Claude Anderson","phone":"413-498-3000 ext.3227","admissionsPhone":"413-498-3227","fax":"413-498-3152","email":"admission@nmhschool.org","academicSummary":"A WELL-GROUNDED EDUCATION CAN TAKE YOU ANYWHERE.\n\nThe intense, immersive learning that NMH offers is a chance to go further. And do more. It starts in small classes with some of the most dedicated and horizon-broadening teachers you’ll ever meet. From there, things exponentially expand. Borders start to break down: between math and science, social justice and sustainability, the campus community and the world at large.\n\nBy the time you graduate, you will be more than ready to break new ground. Many of our students do—at the most selective schools, such as Brown and the University of Chicago; at big public research universities like the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia; at urban, private universities like NYU and Boston University; and at small NESCAC schools like Connecticut College and Middlebury​.\n\nWe'll encourage you to push your intellectual boundaries. Discover a love for poetry you never knew you had. Access an aptitude for quantitative thinking that has not yet been developed. Experiment with learning a new language. Explore unanticipated intellectual challenges.\n\nAnd we will support your journey. As you go beyond the classroom, uncovering learning opportunities through clubs and community service, on teams, in the residence halls, and perhaps through study-abroad experiences, you’ll learn to think like and be a citizen of the world and of your own community.\n\nOur teachers represent the heart of the NMH experience. As credentialed scholars, they’re the equal of any boarding-school faculty in the country. Dedicated and passionate, they will inspire you, nurture your interests, and motivate you to excel.\n\nOur College Model Academic Program (CMAP) provides the richest possible educational experience and gives you a glimpse of what college will be like. By taking three major courses each semester, you’ll spend more time in class with your teachers, which allows for deeper discussion and hands-on projects that increase your understanding of the course material.\n\nOur wide range of courses in all academic departments provides for learning experiences that can be tough, fascinating, meaningful, and, yes, downright fun. Combined with our informed, personal college counseling, an NMH education will not only prepare you for college, but will also challenge you to broaden your view of the world while refining your image of yourself.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean and Director of Studies Sarah Warren","campusLifeSummary":"WHAT YOU DO AT NORTHFIELD MOUNT HERMON IS UP TO YOU.\n\nIf you’re like most of our students, you’ll find that the best way to balance our intense academics is by embracing all sorts of other experiences — from joining a sports team to being in a play to running a student club to volunteering on or off campus. \n\nIt adds up to a busy schedule, but we like to take the big-picture view: It's an experience of self-discovery, happening within a incredibly dynamic community. \n\nAnd don't think for a second that you're going it alone. Our Partnership of 12  ensures that at least a dozen adults — advisors, teachers, coaches, dorm parents — have got your back. They're your own personal support network, helping you figure out and work toward your individual goals. We take on community issues, too, in our bi-weekly “Student Life Seminars” — small-group conversations about health and wellness, diversity and social justice, and other important topics that rise to the surface.\n\nYour home base and social hub — for day students and boarders alike — is the dorm. And they really do feel like home (comfy couches, TV lounges, even outdoor spaces). They're where you’ll study, relax, even find your advisor hanging out after dinner.\n\nIf that advisor turns out to be the cookie-baking type, then lucky you! But rest assured, the dining hall at NMH is something special. Whether it’s stir-fry Tuesday, Meatless Monday, or the on-demand soft-serve ice cream machine that uses NMH farm milk, the food is always delicious and inventive. It’s a good thing the dining hall is open almost all day for grazing! (View the weekly menu here.) We want you to live a fun, healthy, productive life at NMH — check out details about our weekend activities, volunteer gigs, spiritual practice, and wellness resources.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Nicole Hager","studentLifeSummary":"Welcome to NMH! You've discovered one of the most exciting, distinctive boarding schools you could hope to find. I say that with some authority, having worked in boarding schools for 14 years. When I arrived at NMH in 2002, I joined a vibrant, diverse community where individual development, community standards, and high expectations form the core of the academic and student life experience.\n\nAs dean of students, my job is to challenge and support students outside the classroom. Although classrooms provide a rich learning environment, students spend a lot of time outside the walls of our academic buildings, and we offer amazing opportunities to acquire knowledge and experience and contribute to the community through clubs, organizations, and volunteer groups.\n\nWe also have a student life curriculum that promotes self-responsibility, integrity, and moral leadership. Whether it's serving as a class officer, starting a program to raise awareness of the genocide in Darfur, or working on campus sustainability projects, students discover passions they didn't know they had and commit themselves to ideas bigger than themselves.\n\nMany schools profess to educate the whole child. At NMH, we live and breathe our founder's motto to educate the heads, hearts, and hands of young people. I came to NMH—as perhaps you will, too—because part of the school's mission is to encourage students to live with purpose and to make a difference in the world.\n\nNicole Hager\nDean of Students","artsAthleticsSummary":"ATHLETICS \n\nWRITE DOWN YOUR GOALS ON A PIECE OF PAPER. NOW TEAR THAT UP, AND WRITE DOWN YOUR DREAMS.\n\nThat’s the kind of advice NMH student-athletes get from their coaches. Every student here is encouraged to think of athletics as yet another arena in which they can challenge themselves to dig a little deeper and aim a little higher.\n\nAnd they’re more than just skilled athletes. Our students are good sports and great teammates.\n\nNMH offers one of the broadest high school athletics programs in the country, and our College Model Academic Program (CMAP) gives students the time to participate without sacrificing their studies. They learn all kinds of valuable lessons about sportsmanship and leadership that they can apply to other areas of life.\n\n\nARTS\n\nNMH's mission is an \"education for the head, heart, and hand.\" But perhaps we should add the eyes, the foot, or the vocal cords to that list, because for us the arts help make us fully realized human beings. They teach us new ways to see and think about the world and allow us to communicate with our fellow human beings in ways that transcend—and sometimes critique—language, history, religion, and politics.\n\nArt courses at NMH will nurture your appreciation and understanding of a variety of expressive media while developing your creative skills, deepening your confidence in your talent. Whether it's learning about sight reading in music, color theory in the visual arts, movement in dance, or lighting and set design in theater, when you leave NMH, you'll have the skill set to make art the rest of your life.\n\nYou'll learn the vocabulary of art and how to discuss and critique it articulately. You'll also learn the importance of crossing boundaries, collaborating with artists from other disciplines, and even incorporating ideas from science or economics into the way you think about art.\n\nCome to campus and you'll see just how serious we are about art...and how much we celebrate it.","dirArts":"Chair, Visual Arts Mona Seno","dirAthletics":"Chair, Visual Arts Kline","notable":["60 Arts Performances each year","Wrestling Placed Second in New England","Girls Basketball Won Eight School Championship"],"collegeSummary":"The college counselors at NMH are familiar with an impressively wide variety of colleges and universities. We have to be. Because of our students’ diverse backgrounds and interests, it is not enough to have stock answers. We know the Ivies and we know the truly excellent state universities. We know the big-name schools and the hidden gems. We know the conservatories and the art institutes. We know traditional liberal arts colleges and we know the schools that offer both gymnastics and Arabic studies—or whatever combination of programs you are looking for.\n \nWe also help colleges get to know NMH. Our work takes us to college campuses to connect with admission officers, coaches, and professors. We bring more than 100 college representatives to our campus each year to help them more fully understand NMH. They get our school, and that helps them get you.\n \nThe college process is complex and demanding. We understand the challenges and have lots of tools to help you manage the search process and the application itself (see links below). You and your parents can use the links on our website to track your applications. You can follow us on Twitter to get timely reminders. You can read our blog to find answers to your questions.\n \nIn the end, roughly two-thirds of NMH graduates report that they have gained admission to their first- or second-choice college.

For some, it’s a chance to experience a rigorous academic environment, possibly for the very first time. For others, it’s an opportunity to build on their existing foundation and get a jump on college preparation. Summer Session offerings include Middle School, College Prep, and English as a Second Language programs. Classes in all three programs are small (10–12 students) and are supported by both a master teacher and a teaching intern.\n\nOur student population is diverse and worldly; in the summer of 2015, 38 countries and 20 U.S. states were represented. This ensures that everyone meets new friends from all over the world. One of the measures of our success each year is how difficult it is for so many of the students to leave at the end of the summer. They build powerful connections to our community and make lifelong friends. That's our goal: to provide a life-changing experience for each student.","dirSummer":"Gregory","summerPrograms":[{"name":"NMH Summer Session","start":"2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2017-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NMH Summer Session students come from all over the U.S. and the world, and they each have their own goals.

Northwood students take SAT and ACT preparation courses in math and English at no additional cost and work one-on-one with their college counselor to ensure the readiness of all admission materials.

Our residential education programs help students maintain a healthy lifestyle and address issues that concern young people today. We offer the Junior program, Personal and Community Education program (PACE) for Lowers and the All School Meeting as opportunities for student’s personal growth. \n\n\nAdditional support in student life comes from fellow students. One area where this support is demonstrated is in the residential community. Within each dormitory an upper class student applies for and is selected as a proctor or prefect. Proctors live in the upper class dormitories and prefects live in the junior dormitories. These students are crucial in the role of supportive advisor and counselor. They work closely with the adult house counselor to help ensure quiet time and lights out policies, discourage rule breaking and confront students who have difficulty following the rules, supervise the housekeeping program in their dorm, and discuss issues specific to the dorm with the house counselor. They are also available to assist students in navigating life at Andover whether academically, athletically or socially.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Art Department Chair Therese Zemlin","dirAthletics":"Athletic Director Modeste","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Dean of College Counseling Sean Logan","colleges":[],"alumni":[{"name":"Frederick Law Olmsted","year":1838,"description":"Designer, NY's Central Park and Boston's Emerald Necklace"},{"name":"Humphrey Bogart","year":1920,"description":"Actor"},{"name":"George Bush","year":35222,"description":"41st President of United States"},{"name":"Jack Lemmon","year":null,"description":"Actor"},{"name":"George W.

Brought to life by an exceptional faculty, Pomfret offers a rich and rewarding experience for students from various cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.  \n\nThrough a rigorous and engaging education, a commitment to service beyond self, and numerous opportunities for personal growth in academic, artistic, athletic, and residential settings, students emerge as ethical and active citizens of the world.","dirAdmissions":"Amy Graham","phone":"860-963-6100","admissionsPhone":"860-963-6120","fax":"860-963-2042","email":"admission@pomfretschool.org","academicSummary":"The aim of the academic program at Pomfret School is to teach students to use their minds well and to develop in them a spirit of optimism, resilience, and empathy. At Pomfret, learning is not just the retention of facts, information, and foundational tenets of a given subject area, but it is the act of students solving problems and persistently asking questions of the world around them. Learning, which is designed and led by Pomfret’s dedicated, experienced, and innovative teachers, is the result of thinking and grappling with content, which is what our curricular program reflects.\n \nJohn Dewey, American educator and philosopher, wrote in the early twentieth century that students “can only think when confronted with a problem.” Pomfret students have a myriad of opportunities to delve into problems that do not have simple right / wrong answers but instead require deep, skillful thinking and application of knowledge. In each subject area, students are expected to master the content and skills of the discipline; but, more importantly, students are encouraged to combine what they have mastered with their drive and passion for learning in order to solve meaningful problems. Through their active and engaged participation in learning, we expect our students to use content to produce new understandings about the world.\n \nIncreasingly, our academic program is becoming personalized such that students have a voice and choice in their learning. We want students to participate consistently in the design of their learning as they currently do during Project: Pomfret. We want students to connect their interests, passions, aspirations, and unique strengths to their learning process and to the learning objectives designed collaboratively with their teachers.  \n \nIt is apparent to the observer who walks the halls of Pomfret that our students are participating in active inquiry, debate, and exploration. These activities distinguish Pomfret from other schools because they grow from innovative curricular programming and learning practices.  We believe strongly that learning at Pomfret helps students anticipate, embrace, and prepare for their futures in ways that are unlike what is offered at other boarding schools.  We encourage you to join us in this closely-connected community of learners and learning.","dirAcademics":"Director of Grauer Institute Jamie Baker","campusLifeSummary":"The Pomfret campus serves as a home away from home for our students and therefore warm and inviting dormitory living is a priority. Close to 100% of our faculty live on campus, with over 70% serving as dorm parents and affiliates, who are here to supervise, guide, mentor, and support students. A highly valued role at Pomfret, the in loco parentis focuses on the following: providing individual attention to each student, helping students learn from the differences of other students’ backgrounds and beliefs, and developing a sense of unity within each dorm.\n\nThe majority of our third formers (freshmen) live in house dorms in what is known as “freshmen circle,” providing a community within a community for our younger first-year students. There are other house dorms available on campus and four large traditional style dorms, known as “the bricks.” These dorms overlook Pomfret’s “Quad” – a central outdoor meeting place for student activities like barbecues, dances, and casual socializing.\n\nEach dorm unit has a common room that’s comfortably furnished and includes a flat screen television, refrigerator and microwave. These areas serve as convenient spaces for dorm meetings, socials, and a place to relax.\n\nThird and fourth formers (freshmen and sophomores) learn quickly the value of evening study hall, lights-out, and room cleaning regimes. As they become fifth and sixth formers (juniors and seniors), they carry these routines forward as habits. Students and faculty organize their dorm lives by planning everything from fun and meaningful activities to participating in dorm maintenance – all terrific lessons for life in college.\n\nPrefects to help faculty lead each dorm unit. Student prefects are elected and placed by faculty and the role is one of highest regard. All prefects undergo extensive training before each school year begins. They arrive on campus early each year to help prepare for Opening Days and to welcome new and returning students with the spirit and pride that is Pomfret.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Head of School Richard Dempsey","studentLifeSummary":"The Olmstead Student Union, which opened in 2004, is the hub of actvity on the Pomfret School campus.  The student union houses The Tuck Shop, which is a student and faculty cafe offering a variety of food, beverages, and snacks in a relaxed atmosphere, the school store, radio station (WBVC 91.1 FM), student publications office, and student activities office. \n\nOn weekends, there are a variety of options for the students on campus including dances, hypnotists, dodgeball tournaments, trivia events, as well as competitions such as our Airbands competition and Halloween Parade. Pomfret also welcomes visiting hypnotists, musicians and comedians. Pomfret prides itself on bringing students together and features Form Olympics event during the fall, winter and spring. In addition to on campus events, Pomfret provides opportunities for its students to get off campus. Trips to Boston, NYC and Providence are provided throughout the year, as well as mall trips, movie trips, local restaurants, shuttles to the local Target and Walmart shopping areas, as well as shuttles to the local supermarkets.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Since the founding of the School, athletics has played a key role in each student’s Pomfret experience. Many life lessons are taught through the athletic program. Character building, fair play, and appreciation for being a part of a team are goals that we expect every student to experience. The Pomfret athletic program helps students develop self-esteem, promotes their health and wellness, and allows students to develop meaningful relationships through team experiences. \n\nPomfret provides the opportunity to compete on varsity and sub-varsity teams against the best competition in New England. Our 42 athletic teams compete in 15 different sports. Our teams are comprised of college-bound athletes as well as novices picking up a sport for the first time. Our experienced coaches are faculty members who promote sportsmanship, fair play, and team work in every practice and game. They are passionate coaches who value the experience of being on a team as much as the competition. They foster leadership and teach accountability in every activity.  \n\nEvery student can benefit from the experience of creating art. The creative thinking skills acquired by making art can be used throughout one’s life and are crucial to a twenty-first century education. Pomfret School provides a compelling and comprehensive arts program in which students can use their imagination, discover a passion, and gain an appreciation of how the arts enrich and give meaning to life.\n\nPomfret features art courses in fine art, digital art, technology, design, and performing art.","dirArts":"Director of Fine Arts Chip Lamb","dirAthletics":"Director of Fine Arts Sheehan","notable":["NEPSAC Small School Boys Hockey Champions '17","Class B NEPSAC Volleyball Champions '15","NEPSAC Division I Girls Ice Hockey Finalist '14"],"collegeSummary":"College counseling at Pomfret is a highly individualized process with the goal of producing the best possible match between each uniquely talented student and the college or university which best fits that student. Like much of everyday life on campus, the creation of that ideal match is a very personal, labor intensive, learning experience. Each student works closely with his or her counselor to explore the many talents and interests he or she has developed, to set goals based on those experiences, and to research and find the colleges that will help him or her achieve those goals. \n\nPersonal attention is the hallmark of the college search process at Pomfret. Three experienced college counselors, aided by the registrar/testing coordinator and by a full-time administrative assistant, serve a typical class of approximately one hundred students. While each counselor has multiple opportunities to get to know students in the classroom, on the playing fields, etc., guiding them through their college search is our primary responsibility. By visiting college campuses, attending regional and national conferences, and hosting college fairs and individual college representatives at our school, Pomfret’s college counselors constantly update and expand their knowledge about programs available at colleges. This personal contact also fosters close relationships with admissions officers at more than one hundred colleges and universities.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Bruce

Students in grades 9-12 participate in Air Force JROTC, which helps cultivate leadership skills while teaching students responsibility, integrity, accountability, and service before self.\n \nR-MA's goal is to get each student into the college or university that is the best fit for him or her. While we currently have alumni enrolled in Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern, UVA, the Air Force Academy, and West Point--colleges recognized throughout the U.S. and the world--we recognize that some students may be best served in different settings. Therefore, we work with each student to determine what it is they are looking for in their college experience, examine their talents and interests, and find colleges that match those criteria. \n \nR-MA has both an Upper School and Middle School. The Middle School is located on its own campus, but students have the opportunity to take Upper School classes and participate on JV and some varsity sports. Personal attention and a nurturing yet challenging atmosphere are hallmarks of the middle school. The Upper School focuses more on leadership and the level of academics is stepped up as students prepare for college, but there is still a focus on personal attention--getting to know each student as an individual, not just a student.\n\n\"My son came here in sixth grade because I was concerned the large classes at our public middle school would not suit him,\" said one parent. \"He has stayed here because of the phenomenal teachers he has had in both the Middle School and the Upper School.\"","dirAdmissions":"Clare Dame","phone":"540-636-5200","admissionsPhone":"540-636-5484","fax":"540-636-5419","email":"admission@rma.edu","academicSummary":"Randolph-Macon Academy alumni say it all the time: the teachers are the difference. Here, students find teachers who truly care about their academic interests as well as their personal struggles and triumphs. \n\nR-MA is a college-prep school with an Air Force JROTC program. Academics are the priority in a program that helps students develop in the areas of knowledge, leadership, and character. We offer small classes, where students can receive personal attention and engage in discussions, projects, and field trips. Boarding students participate in required study halls in the evenings. Both day and boarding students have the opportunity to seek extra assistance or make up missed assignments (when missed for an excused absence such as a sporting event) during tutorial times. \n\nHonors, AP and college courses are available for high achievers in the Upper School. The college courses are granted credit (upon satisfactory completion of the course) under the auspices of local universities, including Shenandoah University, Lord Fairfax Community College, and James Madison University. Advanced middle school students are also challenged, as they may enroll in select courses at the Upper School. \n\nThere are nine honor societies to recognize students who go above and beyond in their coursework and character. \n\nRequired courses for an advanced diploma include four credits each of English, math, and science, three credits of social studies, three credits of one foreign language (or two different foreign languages, two credits each), two credits of physical education, one credit of religious studies, visual/performing arts and computer applications, and two full credits of electives. Available electives include band, chorus, handbells, art, yearbook, Utopia/Dystopia, 20th Century Warfare, The Arts in Society (Honors class) and others (choices vary by year). Students are also required to take aerospace each year they are enrolled in the Upper School. Grades 6-10 take double periods of English.","dirAcademics":"Upper School Academic Dean Jonathan Ezell","campusLifeSummary":"Practicing \"Thriller\" in the dining hall at night, hanging out watching a movie, bumming snacks from your roommate, flying giant styrofoam gliders, doing homework during a mandatory study hall, engaging in avid discussions with college freshmen who have returned to campus, laughing with your friends--residential life at R-MA is an extension of both the home and the classroom.\n \nAll dorms have two students to a room. The Middle School dorm has four hallways—three halls for boys, one for girls. Like the Upper School boys’ dorm, the bathrooms are community-style. In the Upper School girls’ dorm, the set-up is suite-style; two rooms (four people total) share a bathroom.\nEach hall elects a representative to the student life committee, which meets once a week to address student concerns. There are weekly residential hall meetings as well, in which concerns may be addressed or topics such as bullying, career choices, or college life may be discussed. These meetings are sometimes run by the adult who lives on the hall with the students, and other times may be student-run, depending on the topic of the evening.\n\nWeekend trips include a variety of activities, such as: attending professional sporting events in DC; visiting area museums; horseback riding; paintball; movie trips; mall trips; and theater trips. Trips vary from year to year.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Student Life Todd Davis","studentLifeSummary":"R-MA provides an emphasis on academics, leadership skills, cultivating a “service before self” mentality, and having fun! Sports, clubs, dorm life, and other programs meld together to promote friendly competition and teamwork in the spirit of growing personally and bettering the community overall. Of particular note is the fact that the concept of community service is so entrenched at R-MA that the student body serves over 12,000 hours each year, in spite of the fact that R-MA has no community service requirement for graduation! R-MA students also have a lot of fun; in addition to on-campus sporting events, dodgeball competitions and guest speakers, students have the opportunity to go on weekend trips such as paintball, amusement parks, shopping malls, and skiing. Students who live close enough to go home on weekends are allowed to do so every weekend except during two pre-announced \"closed weekends.\"","artsAthleticsSummary":"R-MA offers a variety of arts and athletic programs both within the academic day and as extracurricular activities. Band, chorus, and handbells are academic classes that perform often during evenings and on weekends. Classes for beginning percussion and beginning brass and woodwinds are available at the middle school level. Because R-MA is a small school with a wide variety of sports, participation on a sports team is highly encouraged, and cuts are the exception rather than the rule. The Middle School competes in the Valley Middle School Conference, while most of the Upper School teams compete in the Delaney Athletic Conference.","dirArts":"Fine Arts Department Chair Ed Richards","dirAthletics":"Athletic Director Sullivan","notable":["Band won \"Best Visiting Band\" award at the DC St.","Patrick's Day Parade in 2015.",""],"collegeSummary":"R-MA’s college counseling office seeks to help each student find the “right fit” for him or her: a college where he or she will be successful yet challenged.

The many student clubs available include newspaper, chapel servers, film club, fencing, core strength & conditioning, international cooking club, art curators and many more.

The goals of the Dorm Life Program include teaching community living skills, developing conflict resolution skills, promoting health and wellness, teaching an awareness of the conservation of energy, and developing a sense of dorm spirit. One of the highlights for the students is “Dorm Nights” which are scheduled every other week throughout the year. Dorm Night activities include intramural competition in volleyball, basketball, broomball, and climbing wall. There is also a talent show, an air band contest, spelling and math competitions, and a chess tournament. The results of these activities are recorded throughout the year. The program culminates when the coveted “Dorm Cups” are awarded to the winners of the upper and lower divisions at the end of the year. Holiday celebrations and birthday/pizza parties enhance the family atmosphere in the dormitories.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Rick Butler","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"Rumsey Hall’s Athletic Program is based on a philosophy of honor through effort with hard work and steady effort resulting in a long tradition of success.

sets Saint Mary's School apart from other schools? Our parents say it’s small classes and extraordinary college admission services from two full-time college counselors.  Our students say it’s the sense of community, the Honor Code, “space to be yourself,” and a generous lunch period.  However, two identity markers also make Saint Mary’s School a distinct option for high school:  we are all girls, and we are a boarding school, as well as a day school. “Growing up girl” is harder than ever, and Saint Mary’s is intentional in its efforts in helping girls grow up healthy.  In an all-girl environment, Saint Mary’s students enjoy not just equal opportunity, but every opportunity, and learning takes center stage without social distractions.  Here girls are supported by a culture, climate, and community that together generate high levels of personal and academic self-confidence and a can-do attitude.  It’s a place where it’s cool to work hard and be a good student.\nAs a boarding school, Saint Mary’s provides a 24-hour learning environment focused on education supported by heightened interaction between students and their teachers, who see their work as a calling, not a job.  Day students at Saint Mary’s have unique advantages, not found at other day schools, for extraordinary access to the school’s facilities, programs, and people—days and nights, weekdays and weekends.  Of course, Saint Mary’s is more than college preparatory, independent, all-girls, day and boarding school.  It is an honor code school, an Episcopal school, a tablet computer school, and an old school with a storied history and proud heritage.  As one alumna aptly describes it, “Saint Mary’s is a fabulously modern take on a very traditional concept.”","dirAdmissions":"Kim Slade","phone":"919-424-4100","admissionsPhone":"919-424-4100","fax":"919-424-4122","email":"admission@sms.edu","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Dean of Teaching & Learning Leslie Owen","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Tim Healy","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":" Jennifer Moran","dirAthletics":" Monroe","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Each student at Saint Mary's works with an academic and college counselor, who provides help for students and parents beginning with a student's enrollment at Saint Mary's and continuing through her application to colleges and universities and graduation.

Salisbury begins preliminary college planning with larger group meetings in the third and fourth form years.  In January of their Fifth Form, the School hosts a symposium for students and their parents with admissions officers from some of the nation’s most elite colleges and universities.  By spring, each fifth former will have had numerous meetings with his college advisor and developed a list of schools to visit.  Beginning in the fall of their sixth form/senior year, boys work closely with the College Office to narrow their list of choices and organize applications.\n \nAs admission to the most selective colleges continues to be increasingly competitive, Salisbury is proud of its record of matriculating over 65% of recent graduating classes to colleges classified as “most competitive” or “highly competitive” and sending 85% of the Sixth Form to their first and/or second choice schools.  \n \nSalisbury strives to make the college advising process a partnership between a boy, his parents and the School. We offer guidance, resources and tools to make this individually-tailored selection process as easy as possible.  Our ultimate goal is, of course, to ensure that students select colleges where they will be successful, challenged, and happy.","dirCollege":"Director of College Advising Bobby Wynne","colleges":[{"name":"Bates College","attending":4},{"name":"Boston University","attending":4},{"name":"Colby College","attending":4},{"name":"Colgate University","attending":4},{"name":"Dickinson College","attending":4},{"name":"Drexel University","attending":4},{"name":"Duke University","attending":4},{"name":"Elon University","attending":4},{"name":"Gettysburg College","attending":4},{"name":"High Point University","attending":4},{"name":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","attending":4},{"name":"Ithaca College","attending":4},{"name":"Loyola University (MD)","attending":4},{"name":"New York University","attending":4},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":4},{"name":"Quinnipiac University","attending":4},{"name":"Sewanee","attending":4},{"name":"St. Lawrence University","attending":4},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":4},{"name":"Trinity College","attending":4},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":4},{"name":"Union College","attending":4},{"name":"United States Naval Academy","attending":4},{"name":"University of California Berkley","attending":4},{"name":"University of Delware","attending":4},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":4},{"name":"University of Richmond","attending":4},{"name":"University of Vermont","attending":4},{"name":"University of Virginia, and many more","attending":4},{"name":"University of Maryland","attending":4},{"name":"Chapman University","attending":4},{"name":"Connecticut College","attending":4},{"name":"Dickinson College","attending":4},{"name":"Furman University","attending":4},{"name":"Skidmore College","attending":4},{"name":"University of Colorado","attending":4},{"name":"University of Denver","attending":4}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"Since 1946, Salisbury Summer School has been working with boys and girls in grades 7-12 who are striving toward important educational milestones in their academic careers.

1950, Santa Catalina has been a leader in education for young women.

The curriculum will expand your mind and stimulate your curiosity. \n\nWe teach the way girls learn most effectively, often with open discussion and group projects. Our faculty is available, involved, and interested in you. They know the point of school is not so much what you learn, as what learning allows you to accomplish in the world when you leave. \n\nYour personal and academic journey will include preparation for life beyond our campus. Our college counseling program will support your journey, and your college decisions will be informed by your academic, co-curricular, and extracurricular experiences. When you take that next step, you join generations of young women who began inventing their futures at Santa Catalina and are now realizing their dreams. \n\nIf you’re looking for a school that helps you discover the person you are meant to become – Santa Catalina is the place to begin.","dirAdmissions":"Jamie Buffington Browne '85","phone":"831-655-9300","admissionsPhone":"831-655-9356","fax":"831-655-7535","email":"admission@santacatalina.org","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Head of Upper School Kassandra Thompson Brenot ’87, Ph.D.","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Interim Director of Resident Life Connie Riley","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Department Chair of Visual Arts Michelle Avery","dirAthletics":"Department Chair of Visual Arts Elliott","notable":["2016 Varsity Volleyball: 22-0","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Colleen Murray","colleges":[{"name":"Boston University","attending":13},{"name":"University of San Diego","attending":12},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":8},{"name":"Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo","attending":8},{"name":"University of San Francisco","attending":8},{"name":"New York University","attending":6},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","attending":5},{"name":"University of Oregon","attending":5}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"Summer at Santa Catalina is a place filled with play, joy, and learning.

Three age-specific campuses with extraordinary resources, teachers who actively mentor, a forward-thinking curriculum, a diverse and inclusive community, and a legacy of alumni accomplishments all inspire Shady Side students to high achievement in academics, the arts and athletics, and to meaningful ambitions in life. \n\nShady Side offers two options for an enriching boarding experience. Five-day boarding allows those who live close by to spend time with family on weekends.  Seven-day boarding is great for students who live beyond commuting distance and want to open themselves to further opportunities through weekend cultural, educational and service activities that take advantage of our campus and proximity to Pittsburgh.\n\nAt Shady Side, there is a balanced approach to education with a commitment to students’ academic, physical and emotional development. Putting that approach into action is a caring faculty and staff dedicated to fostering a true love of learning. Small class sizes encourage a strong sense of community and Shady Side’s academic program provides a challenging yet nurturing atmosphere in which learning occurs at the highest levels. \n\nThe broad academic program exists in an atmosphere that encourages inquiry, questioning, self-determination and creativity.  Arts and athletics are an integral part of the curriculum. Music, visual and performing arts are intertwined at all levels of learning, and students are encouraged to explore an array of athletic options to find the sport or activity best for them. Extracurricular activities and clubs support students’ diverse interests. \n\nFaculty members are leaders in their respective fields. Sixty-five percent hold advanced degrees, and they participate regularly in professional development activities. They believe in a traditional approach to learning while developing creative curricula and determining how to best meet the needs of individual students. \n\nSenior School students (grades 9 - 12) refine critical thinking, writing and analytical skills that distinguish them in the college search, while three full-time college counselors help them prepare for the next stage of their academic careers. The Academy enjoys a 100 percent college matriculation rate.","dirAdmissions":"Robert Grandizio","phone":"412-968-3000","admissionsPhone":"412-968-3180","fax":"412-968-3213","email":"Rgrandizio@shadysideacademy.org","academicSummary":"The Senior School has an extensive academic curriculum, designed to help students collect, analyze and synthesize data; state and support arguments; and work effectively with groups of people.\n\nThree elements form the basis of the academic program:  1) Students are dedicated and thoughtful in their work. This is apparent in classrooms and communal spaces around campus, where students can be seen applying themselves to academic work.  2) The faculty creates an experience that helps students grow and gain knowledge. They challenge students to develop through a host of academic activities.  3) Shady Side Academy is a learning community; we work together to grow and learn.\n\nKnowing that every person learns differently, Shady Side Academy provides a unique learning environment for each student. Small classes enable teachers to know students as individual learners and help each one develop in a way that is personally beneficial and fitting.","dirAcademics":"Head of Senior School Sophie Lau","campusLifeSummary":"The Senior School experience is an all-inclusive one that engages students throughout the entire day. Students begin classes at 8:15 a.m. and participate in a variety of activities until late afternoon or early evening. From the classroom to the art studio and stage, from the playing field to the dorm (for boarding students), students and teachers share a common experience that leads to close student/faculty relationships.\n\nEverywhere on campus, dedicated faculty members work to create an interconnected experience that helps students develop into the people they hope to be. Research shows that students benefit greatly from being part of a thoughtful, academic community, and the Senior School faculty and staff work to create such an environment every day.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students and Director of Residential Life Chad Green","studentLifeSummary":"The Student Life Office is responsible for overseeing school experiences that occur outside the academic classroom and off the athletic fields. From organizing new student orientation to holding class elections, the Student Life team seeks to provide experiences that allow students to grow to their full potential while being shaped by the Academy’s Guiding Principles. Student government, clubs, fundraisers, school dances, CUP days, producing the Daily Bulletin and coordinating the advising program are all part of the Student Life Office.\n\nStudents enjoy a college-like atmosphere on our 130-acre campus, with six academic buildings, two dormitories, a professional theater and full athletic facilities.\n\t\nA variety of leadership opportunities exist for Senior School students to develop their leadership skills.\n\t\nShady Side offers a Service Learning program that engages students with community service that is both local and global.\n\t\nStudents have the opportunity to join and lead student clubs based on their interests, with guidance from a faculty advisor.\n\nThe Student Life Staff includes the dean of student life, the four form deans and the director of student activities.","artsAthleticsSummary":"The Senior School offers a rich, multi-faceted arts program that builds fundamental arts skills in core courses while providing continued stimulation through an array of electives. Students have the opportunity to explore their creative interests and develop their unique talents. \nShady Side's athletic program is divided into three distinct areas: athletics, physical education and health education. The primary goals at the junior varsity and freshman levels are skill development, physical conditioning, knowledge of strategy, discipline, fun and game participation. Success in competition is encouraged, but not at the expense of student participation or individual preparation for an upper level team.  At the varsity level, one of the primary goals is to field highly competitive teams. Shady Side Academy athletes are expected to exhibit excellence in skill, discipline, teamwork and sportsmanship as well as pride in self and in Shady Side Academy.","dirArts":"Arts Department Chair Daniel Brill","dirAthletics":"Arts Department Chair Deal","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The College Counseling staff works as a team to help all Shady Side Academy students reach their future goals.

You have to love teaching in order to teach here,” declared a Grade 11 student recently. Indeed. Shawnigan teachers are highly qualified, dedicated, and accomplished, and they create a learning environment relevant to the 21st century. They demand commitment and hard work from students. The result is personal excellence, whether that means a full-slate of APs and admission to top universities in North America or abroad, or finally earning an 80% average.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Academics Wendy Milne","campusLifeSummary":"During opening week, a Grade 12 student offered this insight to the student body: Here’s a little message, not from someone who’s told to make the school sound good, or someone who can gain anything from it; only someone with a bit of experience here. \n\nThis school is what you want it to be. You can rant and rave about life here all you want, or you can take advantage of what it has to offer.\n\nThere is so much opportunity in this place. Things you might never have a chance to experience again are sitting waiting for you to try. These are the years in your life when it’s easy to discover and explore, when you don’t have any set path—so go for it! \n\nYou could learn how to make a shirt or a table, the rules of squash, or how to schedule voice lessons between graphic design and dinner with your roommates. Some things I’ve learned: How to make a bowl. I figured I’d get tired of pottery after a week, but I made more bowls than you can imagine, and despite what I thought, I loved it.\n\nOn the athletic side, People that know me can tell you I’m not a born runner, in fact, I am passed by power walkers and children—often. After joining cross country last minute, I surprised myself: I was running, and for some reason, I no longer thought of ways to fake a heart attack so I could stop (I still do that when I erg, though).\n\nThese are just some things I learned when I branched out of my usual niche: I promise that if you hold back, if you don’t capitalize on all these resources in front of you, you’ll regret it. \n\nDon’t think that you’re in this alone, either. You have so many people that will support you if you decide you want to try ballet or if you can’t figure out a math problem. Believe it or not, the people in this room are going to be beside you for this entire year, and some for the years ahead. You will make friends with them—some of the closest you’ve had—and you’ll grow together within these gates. They will be there when you need them, when you don’t need them, probably even when you don’t want them. It’s not going to be hunky dory all the time, it never is, There will be rainy days, fights and bad meals, but I swear to you, when you try to make the best of it, you will live out days and nights that you’ll remember for the rest of your life.\n\nLike I said, this isn’t coming from authority or power, it's just coming from a little experience.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Student Life Matt Clinton-Baker","studentLifeSummary":"Shawnigan prides itself on being the largest boarding school in Canada and Western America with 90% of its students attending the school as boarders. Although mainly comprised of students hailing from Canada and North America (80%), the student body also represents 30 other nationalities from around the world. The diversity of the international student community offers amazing opportunity for discovery, appreciation and growth at the same time it creates unity in the nine distinctive Shawnigan Houses, which are the very centre of every student's life. For boarders and day-student alike, each of the Houses offers a strong sense of identity and a place to call home while on campus. Friendships are cultivated across all grade-levels, fostered by the big-brother, big-sister groups in each house and House spirit is encouraged by house outings and Inter-house Events, which are always a fantastic opportunity to band together.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Shawnigan is an opportunity for you to discover yourself not only intellectually but also athletically and creatively. That is why all students are required to take one sport and one fine art elective each term. The philosophy for both disciplines flows out of the School's mission statement to \"lead young people in the pursuit of personal excellence.\" \n\nFor the serious athlete, Shawnigan has both modern facilities and highly-qualified coaches to develop your skills to the next level - and the next, and the next. Our coaches will push you to discover your physical resources and help set new personal goals each term. Many of our coaching staff have international playing experience and likewise many of our athletes go on to compete in the international arena and at top universities.\n\nFor the artist, we have the studios and the instruction to help you grow in your craft and explore your inherent creativity. Deepen your sense of artistry in our pottery studio, woodwork shop, photo lab, music hall, graphic workshop or in variety of other artistic disciplines. Shawnigan students go on to develop their craft in leading art schools in North America and abroad.","dirArts":"Director of Fine Arts Morgan McLeod","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Murdy","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Shawnigan has a full service University Guidance Department with four counsellors available for the 125 graduates each year.

School is a coed, college preparatory boarding and day school for grades 7-12, located in beautiful Bucks County, PA. As a smaller school, every student is known and valued. We offer an environment of educational excellence that prepares students for success in college and beyond. In the Solebury community, we strongly value intellectual challenge and academic achievement, creative and independent thinking, mutual respect between students and teachers, deep respect for each individual and diversity. \n\nAt Solebury, you will find an innovative academic program with an emphasis on interdisciplinary teaching and experiential learning. You will find teachers who want to get to know you and help you succeed, and who will quickly become mentors and friends. \n\nYou will be exposed to the challenging college-preparatory curriculum, with advanced courses as well as unique electives in every subject. \nYou will find a boarding program that provides you with support and structure for your studies as well as ample opportunities for fun.\n\nYou will find a school that believes in students using all parts of their being - where arts and athletics are regarded as equally important and each has a place in the day. \n\nMost of all, at Solebury School  you will find a place to call home.","dirAdmissions":"Scott Eckstein","phone":"215-862-5261","admissionsPhone":"215-862-5261","fax":"215-862-3366","email":"admissions@solebury.org","academicSummary":"Implicit in Solebury’s philosophy is our goal to engage and excite kids about learning. We want students turned on by ideas, committed to their passions, and encouraged by teachers. When this happens in the classroom, all sorts of opportunities open up for students, not the least of which is access to the most competitive colleges. Solebury’s curriculum is academically demanding and addresses the different needs and abilities of our students in creative and innovative ways. Our approach to academics is rigorous, but it's also caring and supportive.","dirAcademics":"Director of Studies Rick Tony","campusLifeSummary":"Students thrive with the structure that boarding provides. Dorm Parents work hard to create a community and make each student feel as safe, cared for, and happy as they would in their own home, while developing the confidence that comes from living away from one’s parents. Boarders hone the skills needed to be an independent learner and person and learn to live and work with people of different interests, cultures, and backgrounds. This experience prepares young people to be successful as college students, as adults, and as citizens of an increasingly inter-connected world. With a carefully structured schedule of classes, activities, and evening study hall, there is time to relax and enjoy the boarding experience, creating lifelong friendships. Our dining hall is staffed by four wonderful chefs and is often the hub of campus activity. A full breakfast is served every weekday, and lunches and dinners include homemade soups, a salad bar, and vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Fruit, snacks, and hot and cold drinks are available throughout the day for a quick pick-me-up.\n\nSolebury’s location allows for a wide variety of weekend activities. The idyllic 90-acre campus is the perfect backdrop to relax and experience the peace of a rural countryside, perhaps enjoying a football game, an outdoor fire on a crisp fall evening, or an impromptu jam session. Students organize and participate in sports, dances, festivals and other community building activities. Within a few miles of campus students can experience New Hope and the other gorgeous Bucks County towns and enjoy restaurants, shopping, and various festivals throughout the year. Within 30 minutes of campus are five different malls and multiplexes which are always popular with students. Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy the opportunity to go for a hike or a bike ride, tube or canoe on the Delaware River, or try their hand at rock climbing. The Pocono Mountains and the skiing and snowboarding they offer are an hour and a half away, as is the Jersey Shore and its beaches. Finally, Solebury is only an hour from Philadelphia and an hour and a half from New York City for those who love the big city.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Annette Miller","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Visual & Performing Arts Department Head Erika Bonner","dirAthletics":"Athletic Director Eichem","notable":[null,null,null],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Tim Gallen","colleges":[{"name":"Yale University","attending":1},{"name":"George Washington University","attending":5},{"name":"New York University","attending":5},{"name":"Brown University","attending":2},{"name":"Reed","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"Joyce Bulifant","year":1956,"description":"Actress"},{"name":"James MacArthur","year":1956,"description":"Actor"},{"name":"Jack Coleman","year":35316,"description":"Actor, Currently a cast member of science fiction series, Heroes."},{"name":"Langhorne Slim","year":null,"description":"Musician"},{"name":"Elizabeth Pitcairn","year":null,"description":"Renowned Violinist-Plays 1720 \"Red Mendelssohn\" Stradivarius"},{"name":"Mira Nakashima","year":null,"description":"Renowned furniture maker- Daughter of renowned furniture maker George Nakashima"},{"name":"Rachel Simon","year":null,"description":"Author"}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"","dirSummer":"","summerPrograms":[{"name":"Summer Day Camp","start":"2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Summer Camp is for children ages 4 years old through 6th grade.

Fully committed to our rigorous academic program, our students are dynamic, actively exploring their passions in athletics, the arts and service—both to humanity and to the environment. This vibrant community is characterized by high expectations, trust, kindness and compassion. St. Andrew's values diversity. Over 45 percent of students receive over $6 million in financial aid. Students from all backgrounds bring their interests and passions—emerging as engaged and responsible citizens of the world.","dirAdmissions":"Matt Wolinski","phone":"302-378-9511","admissionsPhone":"302-285-4231","fax":"302-285-4275","email":"admissions@standrews-de.org","academicSummary":"Our academic program reflects those qualities of mind we value most: thoughtfulness, inquisitiveness, creativity and a respect for rigorous scientific inquiry. These values find expression in a sequence of requirements in the core subject areas of English, history, science, mathematics, classical and modern languages, religious studies and the arts; a commitment, particularly in the early years, to the teaching of writing, critical reasoning and scientific investigation, and a deep belief in the world's religious, philosophical and artistic traditions as a lasting source of wisdom and hope.\n\nOf course, what will be missing from any description of our program—and what only a visit to St. Andrew's can provide—is the extraordinary vitality of our academic culture. Here you will see classrooms, laboratories and art studios that are lively, playful and intellectually serious; assessments that are creative and challenging and which have been tested against the best practices of colleges and universities; and students who are motivated, curious and deeply engaged in their work.\n\nIndeed, it is this high level of academic engagement—a quality most educational research suggests is a precondition for success in college and professional life—that most distinguishes our graduates. At St. Andrew's students don't just \"study\" art, science and history; they work, under the careful guidance of our faculty, as apprentice artists and scholars. As they do, they discover the joys and pleasure of authentic inquiry—an experience, we hope, that will sustain them throughout their lives.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Gretchen Hurtt","campusLifeSummary":"Our co-curriculum program is varied, demanding and fun and keeps our campus life very busy. Our students participate in a wide variety of activities including sports, the arts, community service and clubs. There is not one type at St. Andrew's; student are engaged and interested in so many different opportunities. Often the top athlete is also a musician who is a residential leader and deeply committed to community service and global issues.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Headmaster of Student Affairs Will Robinson","studentLifeSummary":"Students live on dorms divided by gender and grade, except for the seniors who are spread across all dorms as leaders, big sisters and big brothers. Dorm life is a  global family, headed by a team of faculty dorm parents who live in homes and apartments attached to the dorm. All meals are served in the main dining hall: breakfast and dinner are informal, at weekday lunches we enjoy a \"sit down\" family style meal at assigned tables. Weekends are busy, many events and trips are organized by the student activities committee and the faculty weekend duty group.

Celebrating individuality. Rejoicing in the natural world. St. Andrew's-Sewanee School students live to serve and love to succeed.\n\nSt. Andrew’s-Sewanee School is committed to instilling in students the skills, creativity, and drive necessary for lifelong success. Students are taught to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and to meet academic challenges via multidisciplinary and hands-on teaching styles. \n\nSAS helps students gain a level of self-reliance that allows them the confidence to care for others and their environment. The school prepares students for the demands of college and life through a rigorous academic program that focuses on critical thinking and advanced writing. Realizing the value of a core curriculum, SAS emphasizes English, history, mathematics, science, foreign language, and the arts. Classes are focused on active learning with teachers facilitating as students seek answers to complex questions. Our block scheduling means that classes are long enough for meaningful learning. In 90 minutes, students can trek into the woods to monitor pond life, perform a play or have a full debate.\n\nBasic requirements for graduation include four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of history, two years of a single foreign language at the high school level, physical science, biology, chemistry, one year of the arts, Introduction to Religion, and Life Issues. Traditionally, students go well beyond fulfilling minimum requirements to partake in electives and a multitude of independent advanced-study opportunities.\n\nScience at SAS is lab and field based allowing students to experience science rather than merely study its theories. In the arts, students have opportunities to take advanced courses in all disciplines. Art, music, and theater may be taken for academic credit.","dirAcademics":"Head of Upper School Kelley Black","campusLifeSummary":"St. Andrew's-Sewanee prides itself on being not just a school but also a community. Long gone are the days when the town of St. Andrew's, as it was called, had its own zip code and post office, but there's still a small town feel to the campus. Residential faculty and their families attend meals in the dining hall. Students who are interested can count on babysitting jobs. \n\nIt's a closeness you can feel from the moment you arrive. On a warm day, students gather in the Adirondack chairs in the main quad to strum guitars or share stories. The picnic tables fill with students bringing their lunch outside to enjoy the breeze under the trees. When the Sewanee fog rolls in, the social scene moves to the Student Union where weekend nights mean a movie and hot cocoa with friends. The basketball court and the firepit (home to many all-campus bonfires) are just outside the Union. \n\nStudents, faculty and staff members weave in and out of one another's lives. Learning and discovery exceed the bounds of the school day and week. St. Andrew's-Sewanee is a community bound together by respect for one another and delight in knowledge. It's a place we think you'll like to call your second home. #youbelonghere","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Laura Clay","studentLifeSummary":"SAS students enjoy the peace, fun, and beauty of mountaintop campus with two lakes, incredible views, and 13 miles of trails. They enjoy the lectures and art scene of a college town. They also enjoy weekend trips to movies, shopping, and concerts in nearby Nashville and Chattanooga. Mostly, though, what they enjoy is each other. \n\nSAS is the center of activity for boarding AND day students. Weekends welcome everyone back on to campus for activities in the Union, sporting events, and more.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Get off the bench and out of the audience.

The second semester of the junior year, the student-counselor relationship is formalized. Counselors hold individual meetings with both parents and students to start the more intensive college research process.

Mission: Building Fine Young Men, One Boy at a Time.\n\nSt. George’s School is a world-class boys’ university preparatory school offering a day program for students in Grade 1 to 12 and a boarding program for Grade 8 to 12. With a total enrollment of 1150, of which 110 are boarding students from over 20 countries worldwide, St. George’s School has achieved national and international prominence in many academic, artistic, and athletic competitions. The School enjoys the reputation as one of the preeminent schools in Canada. Here are some of its unique characteristics:\n\nWe are Canada’s World School For Boys: There is compelling research evidence to suggest boys and girls learn differently. We are a school that focuses on the specific needs of boys while ensuring that each of our students has a global mindset.\n\nWe are Committed to Authentic Learning: Gone are the days when learning was all about memorization. Using approaches like Harkness and project-based-learning, our students are consistently shown how to apply learning in real life, problem-solving contexts as they seek authentic connections between their curricular and real world problems.\n\nWe Offer Some of the Most Diverse Curricular Options in North America: Whether it’s our Advanced Placement classes, Latin, Underwater Robotics Club, rugby and basketball teams, or our seven award-winning bands and ensembles, breadth and depth is at the heart of who we are.

Each new student's course of study is individually planned with the advice of the director of studies. Course levels are assigned by department heads on the basis of academic proficiency, not grade level or age.

We offer a wide variety of programs and levels of competition so that all students may be challenged and build self-confidence by participating in competitive sports at the appropriate level. We strive for excellence by encouraging our students to reach for ever-higher levels of proficiency, and we foster a sense of community by respecting and honoring our athletes' contribution to the school.\n\nSt. George's fields a total of 48 interscholastic athletic teams, with virtually all of its coaching staff also serving as full-time faculty members.

These courses run from June 23rd to August 1st, 2014 and provide a total of 120 teacher contact hours of instruction and a further 100 hours of English tutor/Educational Assistant contact hours. This is a homestay program, as we want our boarding students, in particular, to have a break from residence over the summer and have the chance to speak English socially and live with one of our wonderful host families.\n\nThe program is divided into morning classroom lessons and afternoon and evening experiential lessons. The course outline gives an overview of the morning classroom lesson content. The afternoon and evening learning activities focus on getting students out of the classroom into learning programs and experiences to improve written responses about the vibrant summer opportunities throughout Victoria.\n\nFull details online at https://www.stmarg.ca/sms-programs/summer-school","dirSummer":"Jeff","summerPrograms":[{"name":"English 11","start":"2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This rigorous six-week International English Language program is designed for students wanting to get ahead, and challenge themselves to achieve stronger results in English 12.

Quod Agis: Whatever you do, do it well.  St. Mark’s School motto has guided our community for more than 140 years.  Founded in 1865 as an intentionally small residential community, the School challenges its students to develop their particular analytic and creative capabilities by both inspiring their academic and spiritual curiousity and kindling their passion for discovery.  Small seminar-style classes, a challenging curriculum and strong connections that students and faculty make in our classrooms are distinctive features of our academic program. Our community strives to maintain diversity amongst its students and faculty as refelected by their backgrounds and interests.  Affiliated with the Episcopal Church and rooted in that tradition, St. Mark's embraces the rich diversity of the many faiths and nationalities of our students, faculty and staff.  Our close proximity to Boston allows us to take advantage of rich cultural offerings. St. Mark's graduates leave with superior academic knowledge and confidence in their personal worth, strengthened and informed by a heightened sense of purpose, integrity, and citizenship.  We value cooperation over self-interest, and we encourage each person to explore his or her place in the larger world beyond our campus.","dirAdmissions":"Anne Behnke","phone":"508-786-6000","admissionsPhone":"508-786-6118","fax":"508-786-6120","email":"admission@stmarksschool.org","academicSummary":"The curriculum and requirements at St. Mark’s present students with many choices, as the school seeks to provide a broad, balanced curriculum with the opportunity for students to pursue their academic interests to the highest levels. We take time to be certain that all students are introduced to the skills necessary to be successful in courses like Third Form Seminar and then encourage them to build on those skills and pursue work at advanced levels in all disciplines.\nThe school’s greatest academic resource is the people who participate in the academic program, including the teachers, students, and support staff. Classes are small, with an average class size of 10. Many classes are taught around a discussion table, and while teachers lead the sessions, students usually direct them. \nAt the advanced levels, the school offers Advanced Placement courses in almost every discipline for a total of more than 20 courses. Many students go beyond the AP level for advanced work in small classes or independent studies with interested faculty members. Every year, the English Department introduces new sixth-form electives based on faculty interests. In recent years, offerings have included Shakespeare, Representations of the Civil War, Chaucer, and Detective Novels. In the sciences, students are encouraged to develop a basic literacy in the core sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology), but the school offers opportunities for advanced work in all areas and encourages independent research through courses like Introductory DNA Science. In the arts, students are encouraged to develop existing interests and to explore their talents in new ways. The department offers advanced courses in drama, ceramics, studio art, and music, as well as art history.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Academics Nat Waters","campusLifeSummary":"Every day, within the walls of the Main Building, students attend classes, socialize over meals in the dining hall, and enjoy community-building events, such as weekend activities and twice-weekly all-school meetings. Just a few steps through the cloisters is Belmont Chapel, in which we share our spiritual lives. Our state of the art Performing Arts Center  hosts student concerts and theater productions, and the Michel Faculty Athletic Center and numerous playing fields,  are the setting for our multitude of teams.

While we do not require coats and ties daily, we do expect our students to conform to a dress code best described as “neat casual.” No jeans are allowed, and boys must wear collared shirts. Girls can wear either dresses, skirts, or dress pants. Sneakers are allowed. Are there scheduled study hours? Yes. Faculty supervised evening study runs from Sunday evening through Friday evening from 7:30-9:30 pm. Students typically work quietly in their rooms, at their desks, completing their homework. Are athletics required? Third and Fourth Form students are required to participate in an interscholastic sport in the fall, winter and spring. Fifth Formers participate in an interscholastic sport for at least two seasons, while Sixth Formers participate in as interscholastic sport for at least one season. What are clubs and activities like? St. Mark’s boasts more than 30 student organizations that meet a full range of interests and passions. Students can involve themselves in drama, music, the school newspaper, or the St. Mark’s Society – the school’s community service group that sponsors a wide range of hands-on service opportunities. Social activities include dances both on campus and at neighboring schools, trips to the movies and mall, as well as skiing, hiking and apple-picking excursions. Students can also take advantage of frequent cultural and social outings to Boston and the annual school trip to the New York Metropolitan Opera.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Arts Department Chair Les Baird","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Levandowski","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The guiding philosophy behind the work we do in the St. Mark’s College Counseling Office is collaboration. Our team approach fosters information, experience, communication, trust, encouragement and the building of relationships; guiding and supporting each of our families through the intricacies of an increasingly complex college admissions process. Offering students a systematic, syllabus-anchored approach to finding the college that best suits their ambitions and aspirations is the primary goal. From the initial college exploration through the May 1st deposit deadline, families work directly and meet regularly with their designated college counselor to discuss and make appropriate choices. In the end, the student has been provided with advice, strategy, extensive information about colleges, and has grown in a variety of ways by the time enrollment in college takes place.\n\nWhile the formal advising program does not start until winter of the V Form year, college guidance is available to St. Markers as soon as they arrive on campus. When requested, our team collaborates with III and IV Form students, their families, advisors and the Director of Studies in planning an appropriate and intellectually stimulating course of study. In addition, we are happy to offer guidance about athletics, extracurricular activities, and summer programs – all potential factors in college admission. Given the breadth and depth of the opportunities available at St. Mark’s, we encourage students to deviate from what colleges normally expect as long as the choices are made thoughtfully and with genuine commitment.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Eric Monheim","colleges":[{"name":"MIT","attending":4},{"name":"Bates College","attending":10},{"name":"Georgetown","attending":10},{"name":"Columbia","attending":6},{"name":"Boston College","attending":16},{"name":"Colby","attending":9},{"name":"Cornell","attending":7},{"name":"Dartmouth","attending":3},{"name":"Brown","attending":3},{"name":"Yale","attending":2},{"name":"Harvard","attending":2},{"name":"Tufts","attending":7},{"name":"Stanford","attending":2}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"THE GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE.\nJuly 6th - July 12th, 2014\nAn innovative collaboration between Salzburg Global Seminar in Austria and St. Mark’s School in Southborough, MA designed to educate and support faculty and high school students as they learn ways to become engaged global citizens actively working to solve problems of global and local significance.   \n\nBring a team of students for a stimulating week of study, conversation and understanding.

Dorm parents are available to the students during the nighttime hours. \n\nEach dorm floor has Resident Assistants (RA's) students, who are selected by the faculty to serve as mentors, role models, friends and floor monitors. All RA's go through a comprehensive, year-long, training process and are overseen by a senior faculty member. These student leaders help the dorm parents maintain a positive, familial dorm environment.\n\nEach dorm floor has a student lounge where students can relax, make food and watch television during their free time.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Art Teacher Casey Hanrahan","dirAthletics":"Art Teacher Allen","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Placement Jere Quinn","colleges":[{"name":"Michigan State University","attending":15},{"name":"UMass - Amherst","attending":12},{"name":"Bryant College","attending":8},{"name":"Rutgers University","attending":8},{"name":"Penn State","attending":7},{"name":"University of Wisconsin","attending":4},{"name":"West Virginia","attending":3},{"name":"Villanova","attending":3},{"name":"Boston College","attending":2},{"name":"UConn","attending":10},{"name":"Hofstra University","attending":2},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":1},{"name":"St. Anselm's","attending":4},{"name":"Emory University","attending":1},{"name":"St. Michael's","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"Andre Drummond","year":2011,"description":"Professional basketball player for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association"}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"The summer programs at St. Thomas More School combines academics, study skills, athletics, and summer recreational activities, because we know that you can have a fun and memorable summer and be in a better position to achieve your goals when you return to school in the fall.\n \nWe offer 4 different programs to ensure an age appropriate experience that maximizes your time, effort and results.\n \nWhether you are a middle school student preparing for high school or a high school student wanting to get a head start on your course work or a high school student needing to retake an important classes or two or an international student wanting to focus on your English skills and experience a traditional \"American\" summer, we have a program that fits your needs.  \n \nOur formula for success in the summer is much the same as in our regular session: great teachers, individualized attention, small classes, challenging and fun athletics and extracurricular activities in a 100% boarding environment.

The magnitude of this journey underscores an important point: quite simply, art is fundamental to the human experience. And at St. Timothy’s, art is fundamental to your student experience as well – as a form of communication, as a form of creative expression, and as a way to help you better understand yourself and the world around you.\n\nAthletics - St. Timothy's is a member of the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland (IAAM), which means that our students compete with 31 area high schools in basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, riding, soccer (indoor and outdoor), softball, tennis, volleyball, and badminton. In addition, St. Timothy's also fields non-conference varsity teams in golf, ice hockey and squash. Both competitive and non-competitive physical activity is an important part of life at St. Timothy’s School. Our state-of-the-art fitness center includes a weight training and cardio facility, a 90-foot regulation basketball court, training room, and team locker rooms.

Each year, students are accepted by a wide variety of colleges and universities across the United States and abroad. Our college counseling program encourages girls to start thinking early about their educational goals and provides highly personalized counseling for each student. We also meet with parents regularly to assure family involvement in the college selection process. In keeping with our overall educational philosophy, we encourage students to apply to colleges that will challenge them intellectually and provide them with significant growth opportunities. Our primary objective is to ensure that the student has the best possible college options, that she is comfortable with her choices, and that she finds a good match for her own educational aspirations and expectations.\n\nSt. Tim's is a popular recruiting source for many colleges. We work with each student and her family over several years to develop a reasonable and realistic list of prospective colleges and universities. Students have the opportunity to meet on campus each year with admissions counselors from more than 40 institutions of higher learning. Students are also able to attend information sessions given by colleges and universities in the greater Baltimore community. The Office of College Counseling arranges visits by colleges, takes students to college fairs, organizes all SAT I and SAT II preparation courses and testing, and administers the PSAT exam.

TMI educates students in grades 6-12 and offers a complete college-preparatory program including honors and Advanced Placement courses, as well as competitive athletic program.  Fine Arts electives are offered in studio art, theater, and vocal and instrumental music.  TMI’s nationally ranked, optional JROTC program allows cadets to engage in special activities and all students have opportunities to participate in honor council, student clubs, student government, and community service.   \n\nThe Residential Life program at TMI enhances the mission of the school by providing boarding students a nurturing living environment that enables them to excel and mature within a supportive community.  Both five-and seven-day options are available to students in grades 8-12.  \n\nCampus facilities include: 14,000-volume library; science and computer labs; indoor/outdoor athletic facilities; indoor riffle range; chapel; 6 dorms; and a fine arts center. \n\nThe mission of TMI is to provide an excellent educational community, with values based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, challenging motivated students to achieve their full potential in service and leadership.","dirAdmissions":"Aaron Hawkins","phone":"210-698-7171","admissionsPhone":"210-698-7171","fax":"210-564-6152","email":"a.hawkins@tmi-sa.org","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Head of Upper School Matthew Blake","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Clive Hamilton","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":" Mary Scudday","dirAthletics":" Geyer","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Placement Sarah Murphy","colleges":[{"name":"Harvard","attending":2},{"name":"UT Austin","attending":39},{"name":"Baylor College","attending":21},{"name":"Vanderbilt","attending":9},{"name":"Yale","attending":1},{"name":"Notre Dame","attending":4},{"name":"Princeton","attending":3},{"name":"A&M","attending":34},{"name":"Washington and Lee","attending":3},{"name":"University of the South","attending":6},{"name":"US Air Force Academy","attending":1},{"name":"Rice University","attending":1},{"name":"MIT","attending":1},{"name":"US Military Aca - West Point","attending":2}],"alumni":[{"name":"General Douglas MacArthur","year":1897,"description":"Army five-star general, commander of Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, World War II; Commander, UN forces, Korean War"},{"name":"Tom C.

Located on the picturesque shore of Sippican Harbor, Tabor's stunning oceanfront campus is home to 500 students from across the globe. Small dormitory structure, which average 18 students, provides an exceptional residential program and cultivates a strong sense of community. Tabor graduates often matriculate to the most competitive colleges in the country.\n\nTabor's academic, artistic, athletic, and community service programs provide distinctive opportunities for students to achieve genuine understanding and significant skills and to identify and pursue personal goals. As the \"school by the sea,\" Tabor sustains a unique maritime heritage that embodies, in all its programs, the qualities a seagoing life requires: thoughtful preparation for and awareness of the wider world, perseverance, courage, good humor, a sense of direction, and humility.\n\nTabor faculty encourage all students to explore their interests and develop their passions, to stretch their capabilities and hone their skills. Students must learn to be capable self-advocates, skillful communicators, collaborative team members, and discerning critical thinkers. The Tabor community values intellectual curiosity, open-minded debate, the spirit of inquiry, and integrity in all areas of our school lives, but particularly in our academic pursuits.\n\nThe core values of our mission statement guide everyday life at Tabor Academy for our students and faculty:\n\nTo inspire a life-long love of learning\n\nTo instill a passion for the highest standards of achievement\n\nTo encourage personal responsibility\n\nTo foster care for others and committed citizenship","dirAdmissions":"Andrew McCain","phone":"508-748-2000","admissionsPhone":"508-291-8300","fax":"508-291-8301","email":"admissions@taboracademy.org","academicSummary":"At Tabor Academy, our greatest hope is that our students discover their passions and realize the boundlessness of their potential. Our range of classes across the academic disciplines encourages students to explore their interests and discover their unique strengths. Our commitment to small class size helps us create a lively and active classroom dynamic. We want our students to be active participants and partners in their own learning, rather than passive consumers.\n \nThe hallmarks of Tabor’s academic program are breadth and challenge. With 19 honors and 23 Advanced Placement and Post AP offerings, students can seek additional intellectual challenge in just about any academic area. Every Tabor student crafts a “four year plan,” charting their academic course through the curriculum. Students and advisors revisit those plans together each year in the spring to help students select a suitably challenging and balanced course load.\n\nBecause our teachers are also coaches, dorm parents, and academic and club advisors, students and the adults in the community get to know one another across all facets of school life, enhancing our ability to advise and encourage our students to explore new areas of interests and reach for their own personal standards of high achievement.","dirAcademics":"Dean of Studies Eileen Marceau","campusLifeSummary":"The Tabor experience fosters kinship between students and faculty. It has support services for good health and well-being; rules and deadlines that encourage responsibility and accountability; and provides fun activities to help students make the most of school life.\n\nTabor students enjoy their time and friends here. Alums are forever telling us that their Tabor years are some of the happiest moments of their lives and the friendships they formed have been long-lasting.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Mel Bride","studentLifeSummary":"There is the academic life of the school, there is the extracurricular life of the school, and then there is everything else. It is in the “everything else,” or Campus Life, that some of our students’ most satisfying growth occurs. Campus Life is the space carved out of a busy day where students plot their own unique course tailored to their interests. Do you want to be a part of the dialogue on inclusivity? Or do you want to be a dormitory leader? Maybe you want to get involved in student government, start a student club, sing a cappella, or be on the staff of one of our publications. Not satisfied with our sustainability efforts? Want to get involved in the planning of an active weekend program? Or perhaps you want to get involved in the local community? Campus life is where you start.\n\nWhen you collect all those programs and opportunities that are neither academic nor afternoon co-curricular programs, you realize that, in the end, these are the things that make a school work. Clubs are successful or not depending on student participation and leadership. A great year in the dormitory is entirely dependent on great proctors. Chapel is only as meaningful as the student presenters. All School meetings are only as fun as the students are funny. Publications are as good as their staff and editors, and so it goes. These programs give the school their energy and ethos. How we lead and meet, where we dedicate time and resources, which programs students gravitate toward all contribute to the culture of the school. Great schools place as wide a variety of opportunities in front of their students as there are a variety of students, but great students make those programs successful. When those programs are successful, the result is a rich and vibrant Campus Life.\n \nIt is the mission of everyone involved in the Campus Life of the school to make those opportunities available, accessible, and geared toward personal growth.","artsAthleticsSummary":"At Tabor, we offer all students the opportunity to become involved in competitive sports and fitness activities, from the elite level athlete to students looking to participate in a new sport.\nTabor's arts programs are designed to serve all students, from the gifted, to those looking to experiment.","dirArts":"Art Chair Tricia Smith","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Leary","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Tabor college counselors share a belief that the work we do is intricately woven into a broader and more holistic education at the school. Regardless of when formal college advising commences, important fundamental skills and preparation take root early on in a student’s Tabor education. The college search process at Tabor is highly personalized and we are committed to supporting students and families throughout this journey of exploration and self-discovery. While we believe it is important for the student to take the lead in this endeavor, we invite parents to partner in this undertaking. College counselors at Tabor help each student identify a group of colleges that meet the student's needs academically and that will provide an appropriate environment for a student's continued personal and intellectual growth. Our goal is to find a college or university that best matches each student's talents, interests, and aspirations. The support we provide for students at this critical juncture in their lives insures they are effectively prepared for a successful transition to college. Throughout the college search, we encourage reflection, foster independence, and help develop self-awareness in our students. At every stage in the process, we offer informed advice to students and their parents. We strive to educate each student about the changing landscape in college admission, and help them discover appropriate and diverse options across a range of selectivity, and we always enjoy showcasing their many talents to the colleges to which they apply.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Tim Cheney","colleges":[{"name":"Boston University","attending":19},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":19},{"name":"Boston College","attending":18},{"name":"New York University","attending":17},{"name":"George Washington University","attending":15},{"name":"Trinity College","attending":15},{"name":"Union College","attending":14},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":8},{"name":"UCAL/Berkeley","attending":8},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":11},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":10},{"name":"Dartmouth","attending":5},{"name":"Johns Hopkins","attending":5}],"alumni":[{"name":"Paul Fireman","year":1962,"description":"Founder and President of Reebok"},{"name":"John Fish","year":1978,"description":"President of Suffolk Construction Company"},{"name":"George Graboys","year":35250,"description":"Former CEO, Citizens Bank"},{"name":"Robert I.

They have been diagnosed with dyslexia, other language-based learning disabilities, executive function difficulties, or attention deficits that have created challenges for them in the past. \n\nAt Forman, we embrace different learning styles, address the challenges head-on, and tailor learning to fit the unique needs of each student. The results are students who are happy, engaged, and successful. Students learn from faculty who have extensive professional training in teaching students with learning differences.

Our goal is to provide an optimal learning experience for our students. To do this, we focus on “learning how to learn.” This begins with a faculty that fully understands the different ways our students learn. This common understanding of our learners is reflected in all aspects of our academic program.\n\nIn the classroom, teachers emphasize the requisite skills needed to grasp the lesson. Learning strategies and tools developed and perfected by students working with their learning strategist are then applied in the classroom. Courses are organized so that information is presented in discrete, manageable units. Teachers select appropriate content routines for each class and connect new information to previously learned information. The use of tools specifically created for and tested with students who learn differently improves success in the classroom.\n\nForman offers a wide array of courses in the traditional academic disciplines including English, mathematics, science, history, language and the arts. There are also numerous opportunities to pursue particular or special areas of interest.","dirAcademics":" Jamie Dwan","campusLifeSummary":"The classroom is only one part of the Forman experience. Community Life involves the non-academic parts of the Forman program including dorm life, cultural events, social activities and a community curriculum that teaches various life skills. The Forman program places great emphasis on the opportunities for growth outside the classroom and off the athletic fields. These are also the times when meaningful personal relationships can develop. The goal of the Community Life Program is to provide experiences that contribute to the five core values of the school: character, commitment, community, involvement and excellence.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Terry Walsh","studentLifeSummary":"Forman students can take advantage of a variety of opportunities to pursue personal interests. These can involve clubs, the performing arts, including theater and music, community service and special projects. Students can even propose their own ideas and work with other students and faculty to make it happen. For instance, a group of students wanted to start a cooking club and under the direction of a knowledgeable faculty member, Forman now has a Chef's Club. Thus, students can pursue and develop new interests while building self-confidence and expanding their experiences.","artsAthleticsSummary":"THE ARTS play a vital role in student life at Forman. At the Johnson Art Center, one can find a design class in progress, a band rehearsing, the Forman Ensemble Players preparing for a new show, students editing video projects, or an artist hanging a new exhibit in the gallery. The Art Center houses three floors of creative resources, with three visual art studios, a darkroom with eight enlarging stations, a video editing room, two music studios, a 250 seat auditorium with a full stage and the Risley Gallery, which hosts student and professional art exhibits. Students and faculty produce three theatrical productions each year, along with a number of coffeehouse events and talent shows. ATHLETICS works to instill involvement in interscholastic sports and in non-competitive sports as well. Success for our kids comes through learning commitment and believing in themselves. They learn how to handle the highs and lows of winning and losing.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\nRequired involvement in a competitive team or recreational sport works in conjunction with academic achievement and social well being to create a well-rounded individual. This balance of academic, social, and athletic pursuits is what makes the Forman student complete.","dirArts":" Austin Zimmer","dirAthletics":" McCarty","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The Forman School College Counseling Center provides a comprehensive program of services to help our students navigate the transition to college. Professionally trained college counselors work in a partnership with students and their parents. In the College Counseling program, the unique needs of our students are addressed through coursework and individualized counseling. We provide a great deal of time with each student to help them discover their future path.\n\nBeginning in the Junior year, students enroll in a Perspectives on Learning I course, where they begin their work on self determination, high stakes test preparation and advanced skills development. This course continues into the Senior year, Perspectives on Learning II, where students work to generalize what they have learned to the college setting. This work includes listening to college lectures, the effective use of college texts, accessing accommodations and the use of advanced technologies.

How a student goes about making that decision is as important as the decision itself. For many students, the choice is the first major decision in their life for which they will have almost complete control. At The Gunnery, each student works with one of our three full-time college counselors in a carefully constructed process. The Gunnery College Office collaborates with students and parents to engage in honest self-reflection, which is the cornerstone of an enjoyable and productive college process. Together, we research appropriate colleges that merit further investigation by students. We encourage a healthy perspective with the goal of developing a well-balanced list that leaves everybody involved excited about not only the outcome, but the process as well.

Within a family school environment and a rigorous liberal arts curriculum, we challenge our young people to work hard; think and reason; be fulfilled; serve the common good; and be prepared to lead as citizens of the world, uniquely guided by our motto, “Whatsoever Things Are True.”","dirAdmissions":"Tom Eccleston","phone":"610-326-1000","admissionsPhone":"610-326-1000","fax":"610-705-1753","email":"admission@thehill.org","academicSummary":"The Hill School's academic program embodies the quest for “Whatsoever things are true” by providing an excellent liberal arts education rooted in basic skills and knowledge. The Hill School offers an educational experience that emphasizes intellectual discovery while helping students develop a moral framework by which to live their lives. A Hill education ultimately hopes to create a lifetime of learning inspired by intellectual curiosity, moral virtue, and esteem for human excellence.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Mr. John Dollhopf","campusLifeSummary":"The Hill School is committed to providing a healthy place for young men and women to thrive both in the classroom and beyond. We believe firmly in our traditions of attending weekday chapels as much as wearing a coat and tie to class every day. We value student and faculty fan support at athletic events as much as attendance at a Saturday evening dance or orchestra performance. We respect our greater community enough to send groups of students and faculty into Pottstown to remove litter from the streets and sidewalks, and we respect our tablemates enough to refrain from eating at a seated meal until everyone at the table has been served. From the smallest gesture to the biggest requirement, this is student life at The Hill where every student has the opportunity to make an impact on the community in his or her own way.","dirCampusLife":"Assistant Headmaster for Residential Life Jennifer Lagor","studentLifeSummary":"Students have leadership opportunities every year they are at The Hill, and students are encouraged to get involved in some of the many organizations offered. Leadership positions - such as leading a student club, being a member of the Student Philanthropy Council, or serving on the Student Government Association - are available to students in all forms. Sixth form students, in particular, participate in shaping the tone of each school year through their leadership on campus. Whether an athletic team captain; a dorm prefect; a Student Government or Honor Council representative; editor of student publications The Dial (yearbook), Record (literary journal), or The Hill News (newspaper); a leader of the Big Brother/Big Sister Program; president of a music or vocal ensemble; or a Head of Tour, just to name a few, the School depends on sixth formers to engage with underformers on many different levels. The appointment of leadership positions occurs in the spring of the fifth form year. \n\nWeekend activities are planned by the Director of Student Activities and a student committee, the Student Life Association. Activities include movie and mall trips off campus and special events such as casino nights, dorm competitions, and Saturday night dances. The Committee also arranges live bands for coffee houses or larger concert-style events on campus; trips to Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore for cultural events or shopping, as well as trips to nearby ski areas in the winter months; celebrations of special holidays like Chinese New Year and Cinco de Mayo; special weekend community service opportunities; carnivals or food festivals; on-campus movies; visiting artists; amusement park trips; and more!","artsAthleticsSummary":"We offer 31 interscholastic sports programs; 2 club sports; 9 instrumental and vocal ensembles; and 3 theatrical productions per year.

The college search and application process is a vital piece of the educational experience offered to each Hill student. Not only does this process serve as the culmination to all of the academic preparation embraced during one's time at Hill, but, perhaps more importantly, the process also serves as a journey, a journey into an independent adulthood and further academic career for which one's Hill experience provides the bedrock foundation. The College Counseling Office staff are eager and ready to help all students navigate that journey in a way best suited to their individual abilities and talents.","dirCollege":"Director of College

More than half of a boy's hours at Kiski are spent in and around the dormitory. There are few places where a boy can interact with his peers 16 hours a day – The Kiski School is one of them. Under the supervision of prefects and dorm masters, Kiski boys develop lifelong friendships and learn to be accepting of differences while living in our dorms.\n\nSupporting personal growth and development.\nNothing more fully prepares our boys to be gentlemen throughout their lives than the boarding experience at The Kiski School. It is this aspect of the Kiski experience where boys learn the proper behavior for a member of a community. In addition to the independence required to care for oneself, our boys cooperate with their roommates, working together to keep their room tidy and to resolve the inevitable petty squabbles associated with adolescence. They will learn to schedule their time, avoid procrastination and develop the universally respected habit of punctuality.","artsAthleticsSummary":"ATHLETICS: \nThe Kiski School has a long and distinguished athletic history. The young men who attend Kiski learn a great deal about themselves through their athletic participation. \n\nKiski values the “athletic experience” and the benefits it produces for our students. The concepts of team work, unselfishness, working toward a common goal, and never giving up are invaluable lessons that our graduates carry with them for the rest of their lives.\n\nKiski coaches have a tremendous ability to make the average athlete better, and the better athlete greater. The reason for this is simple: because our coaches spend the extra time with our athletes before and after practice. Kiski produces Division I athletes, but we are just as proud of our Division II and III athletes. \n\nKiski has twenty-three athletic teams and participates in over 300 contests, so there are plenty of opportunities to explore a variety of athletic challenges. Many of our students will participate in sports they have never played before and succeed at them.\n\nOur commitment to athletics is evident in our newly renovated Ross Athletic Center. This 75,000 sq. ft. facility houses professional equipment and training resources.\n\nARTS:\n\nIn our art studio, students paint, sketch, sculpt, and create other forms of visual artwork.\n\nOur drama program produces three major performances each year, and brief sketches on special occasions. \n\nThe music program provides a wealth of opportunities for Kiski boys to develop and share their talent. Introductory courses teach performance, theoretical, and listening skills. The instrumental music program includes a jazz and symphonic ensemble with opportunities for individual study with private instructors. Two singing ensembles, the Glee Club and the Double Quartet, tackle music from the classic Americana to contemporary a cappella. All groups perform numerous times throughout the year, including trips to nearby girls' schools for joint concerts.","dirArts":" Andrew Scott","dirAthletics":" Spahn","notable":["Andrew Scott is a 1985 Kiski School graduate","Chris Spahn, 2016 Lacrosse Coach of the Year",""],"collegeSummary":"The College Counseling Team at Kiski is committed to helping our boys with the entire college search process.

Accordingly, there is a specific agenda that we follow for each group of our boys along the way.\nClearly the college search process is an important one to all people involved; certainly we take our role quite seriously in the College Counseling Office. Working as a team with the administration, faculty and students, we aspire to place each one of our boys in the college or university that offers the best “fit”. Throughout this entire process we will be here as an advocate for each one of our boys and their parents. We are available for any questions that may come up along the way.

Embracing high standards of character, commitment, and achievement, The Knox School encourages students to think critically and creatively. \n\nStudents are the most important part of our community. Their involvement in the life of Knox gives them the unique opportunity to become active participants in their personal growth. They emerge as poised and confident speakers and responsible caring citizens. The Knox School takes great pride in all their achievements and, more importantly, invests in the development of their character.\n\nA beautiful campus, a dedicated faculty, outstanding programs, inspired leadership and engaged students all add up to the Knox experience","dirAdmissions":"Meredith McCaslin","phone":"631-686-1600","admissionsPhone":"631-686-1600 ext.407","fax":"631-686-1650","email":"mmcaslin@knoxschool.org","academicSummary":"At Knox, we treasure students for who they are today, and we dedicate ourselves to helping them discover who they can be tomorrow.  We celebrate their developing selves and challenge to reach their potential. Knox's environment promotes each student's personal and intellectual growth; in turn, our students regularly embrace the freedom to question assumptions, take advantage of the unexpected, and look at things in new ways.","dirAcademics":"Assistant Head of School & Dean Virginia Riccardi","campusLifeSummary":"The heartbeat of any great boarding and day school is the close and often lifelong friendships that students form with each other and with their teachers. At Knox, students begin their day together with their faculty in a community morning meeting. After a full day of classes, they join each other in a variety of athletics and activities. They come together again for dinner before returning \"home\" to their dorms, where residential faculty supervise evening study hall. It is very much a family atmosphere, and because of our small size, students all know each other and they have unlimited opportunities to get to know their teachers outside the classroom. Most faculty members live on campus and many have young families.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Student Life Mark Navins","studentLifeSummary":"The Knox School provides a \"home by the shore\" for all of our students.  Each of the residential houses has one or more faculty members, many of whom live with their families.  Our \"house parents\" serve in the best tradition of \"In Loco Parentis,\" as they look after the academic and social/emotional development of each student.  Our residential faculty are truly special people who do not approach dorm life as merely a job; rather, they know how important their role is in the everyday life of a young person at Knox. They are committed—in unique and individual ways—to ensuring that the students in their care feel valued, safe, and a part of something greater than themselves.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Every year, The Knox School presents a Fall Play and a Spring Musical . as well as numerous performances at all school assemblies.  We have an annual Talent Show, music recitals, Vespers, and end of year performances at multiple ceremonies.  As part of our Arts curriculum, we offer Theatre and Speech classes, Vocal Ensemble, and middle school Performing Arts. In the past year, we have launched a new music program in which all of our middle schoolers participate in a String Ensemble, playing either the violin or the cello. \n\nThe Athletics Program at The Knox School is an integral part of our students' educational experience. Staying true to the school's core values, the Athletics Department promotes the total development of our student-athletes.\n\nOur competitive and interscholastic sports emphasize trust, teamwork, sportsmanship and respect, creating a safe and enjoyable environment for all. As young people face the physical and emotional challenges in athletics, they develop personal values and learn to take intelligent risks.\n\nAn active lifestyle is fundamental to a student's well being, and the Knox Athletic Department allows students a chance to balance their academics with healthy activity. This helps students mature in several ways, learning leadership skills, time management, and cooperation.","dirArts":"Chair of Visual and Performing Arts Patrick Barry","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Townes","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The college search process is an exciting and informative experience. As the world has grown more complex, the process has become increasingly complicated through the influences of college rankings, standardized testing and test preparation, and increased selectivity among elite colleges and universities.\n\nEvery fall, The Knox School hosts a College Fair attended by representatives from leading colleges and universities.\n\nKnox’s College Counseling office helps students identify university settings that are the “right fit” for them based upon criteria such as academic challenge, career goals, general interests, and geographic considerations. College counselors work one-on-one with students to prepare for college admissions, a process that includes ongoing personal college counseling; information sessions during their junior year; college fairs; assistance with materials that add depth and distinction to each application; and most importantly, by encouraging students to follow their passions and become confident and competent young adults.\n\nGuiding students to success involves a team effort between counselors, teachers and advisors. Each student is encouraged to reach his or her full potential by developing critical thinking skills and creative problem-solving, clear and effective written and oral communication skills, and by attaining the highest possible GPA, and through challenging and relevant coursework.\n\nThe college counseling office has an open door policy.  Parents and guardians are encouraged to visit or call at anytime.  Colleges and universities visit Knox in the fall and spring. The office also assists with registration and preparation for the PSAT in both sophomore and junior years, as well as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), SAT Subject Area Tests, and the American College Test (ACT). The office also assists international students in preparing for the TOEFL.","dirCollege":"College Counseling Donna Pergola","colleges":[{"name":"George Washington University","attending":6},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":6},{"name":"Boston University","attending":5},{"name":"Michigan State University","attending":5},{"name":"NYU","attending":5},{"name":"Northeastern","attending":5},{"name":"University of Rochester","attending":5},{"name":"University of Connecticut","attending":4},{"name":"Drexel University","attending":4},{"name":"Sarah Lawrence College","attending":4},{"name":"University of Wisconsin","attending":4},{"name":"Purdue University","attending":3},{"name":"Lehigh University","attending":2},{"name":"Cornell","attending":1},{"name":"MIT","attending":1},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":1},{"name":"Webb Institute","attending":1}],"alumni":[{"name":"Jim Liu","year":2013,"description":"US Junior Golf Champion 2010"},{"name":"Mike Chamley-Watson","year":2008,"description":"US Olympian 2012 Fencing; 3-time First Team All-American"},{"name":"Phebe T.

Ever since James Cameron Mackenzie championed the house system in the 1890s and Edward Harkness and Allan Heely implemented discussion based, Harkness teaching in the 1930s, a Lawrenceville education has been marked by close faculty-student interactions and deep intellectual engagement. Lawrenceville faculty members are expert in their disciplines and committed to teaching well. They work closely with students to help them discover and develop their intellectual passions and think critically and creatively about the world around them and about the challenges and opportunities before them.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean David Laws","campusLifeSummary":"Lawrenceville offers a series of more formal programs addressing issues and topics that fall outside of the classroom. Personal Development classes cover critical topics including time management, sleep, and substance use; in addition, six times per year, all-school presentations and discussions address issues such as honor, sustainability and ethical decision-making. Less-structured opportunities such as house meetings and weekly lunches with faculty regularly address non-academic questions and topics, from current events to everyday ethics.. Through a school culture that deliberately engages these issues, as well as through ongoing discussions with faculty and peers in Harkness-sized groups, students are taught to think critically about personal decisions, encouraging informed and considered choices that foster engaged and meaningful lives.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Blake Eldridge '96","studentLifeSummary":"A Lawrenceville student finds the hours of the day crowded with academic, social, athletic, and community activities. The challenge and goal of a Lawrenceville education is to learn to enjoy the many opportunities available here while managing time in a healthy way. Students are encouraged to choose from a wide range of activities outside their academic requirements, and the daily life of the residential school continues well into the evening as academics and athletics give way to club activities, quiet study, and the many friendships of house life.","artsAthleticsSummary":"ATHLETICS\nLawrenceville regards athletics as yet another educational opportunity for students and a necessary and valuable complement to our rigorous academic expectations. The importance of commitment; the satisfaction of selfless teamwork; the hard lessons of failure; the courage to surmount pain, fatigue, and frustration for a common goal; the virtue of physical conditioning; the imperatives of sportsmanship; and the sheer joy of healthy competition are values that our athletic program is uniquely suited to teach.\nPERFORMING ARTS\nWe explore education through doing by offering courses that challenge students to apply the theory they learn in the classroom, to the practice of art in performance.

Based around large oval tables, classes are taught in seminar format. The principle of teaching around tables is to engage students in the learning process by inspiring them to prepare thoroughly, participate daily, solve problems collaboratively, explore divergent ideas, challenge assumptions, and when appropriate, lead class discussions.\n\nThe academic challenge at The Masters School is impressive, and the teachers’ expectations of students are very high. The curriculum is rich in literature, writing, science, languages, history, mathematics, arts, and comparative religion. 16 Advanced Placement courses are also offered in Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Calculus AB and BC, Statistics, English Literature, English Language and Composition, U.S. History, European History, French and Spanish, Latin, Music Theory, Art History, and Studio Art. Honors sections are offered throughout the science and mathematics curricula, and accelerated classes are offered in French, Latin, and Spanish. In all courses, teachers inspire analytic thinking as well as creative approaches, which means that students learn facts plus high competence and intellectual flexibility.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean  ","campusLifeSummary":"On our 96-acre campus, boarding students live in one of five roomy, family-style dormitories with modern kitchens and common rooms.

Courses in the humanities, mathematics, science, languages, and arts are required at all times.  \n\nThe school has a uniquely international character: the fact that 16% of its population comes from abroad gives students a truly global perspective.  Regular participation in environment teams, which clean the historic building and grounds, and in the outdoor program, which offers trips throughout the region, teach responsibility and respect for the environment. Students graduate from the Upper School with a true liberal arts education. The academic core is a three-year survey of human society from prehistory through present day. Learning to analyze history from political, economic, social, religious, and artistic perspectives lays the foundation for college-level electives in the senior year. \n\nThe daily presence of international students from more than 12 countries creates a global perspective for our whole community and makes our population unique among Seattle-area schools.  International students who receive ESL support are gradually integrated into more courses with American students each year. Physical education, sports teams, arts courses, class trips, the Environment Program and the Outdoor Program offer additional chances for interaction.","dirAdmissions":"Douglas Leek","phone":"206-682-7309","admissionsPhone":"206-682-7309","fax":"206-467-7353","email":"admissions@northwestschool.org","academicSummary":"The Assistant Head of School oversees all programmatic aspects of the school.

in 1867, The Storm King School celebrates a 150 years of helping students translate potential into success as they prepare for college and meaningful lives.\n\nLocated at the peak of Storm King Mountain in the Hudson River Valley, The Storm King School's 60 acre campus is just about an hour north of New York City. As an independent co-ed boarding and day school for students in grades 8-12 and PG, we represent 26 countries this year! We are proud to be one of the few schools in the country that has a 5:1 student/faculty ratio with an average class size of 10 students. With this great ratio, we focus on providing an individualized educational environment that is both supportive and challenging to each student. \n\nThe SKS education is highly experiential and often happens outside of classroom walls. Our teachers often utilize our surrounding resources of New York City, The Storm King Arts Center, or the 3,800 acre Black Rock Forest across the street to name a few. Our diverse college preparatory curriculum (including 11 AP courses; at least 1 in every subject area) stimulates our students and immerses them in a highly engaging education.\n\nPersonal growth is also provided through championship & no-cut athletics, superb performing, visual and fine arts, a wide variety of extra-curricular and weekend activities, and community living that is \"one big family.\" At SKS, we attribute our success and 100% college acceptance rate to small classes, individualized attention and a nurturing learning environment. \n\nThe Storm King School campus has three academic classroom buildings (including a study center with smart boards in each classroom), theatre (230-seat capacity), observatory (with Newtonian telescope), arts center (including a state-of-the-art digital design lab and 3D printer), dance studio, ceramics studio, gymnasium with a wrestling room, cardio fitness center & weight room, fencing studio, two athletic fields, two rock climbing walls, five dormitories, dining hall (with extensive home-cooked menu options and a view that overlooks the Hudson River/Shawangunk Ridge/Catskill Mountain Ranges) and much more!","dirAdmissions":"Marek Pramuka","phone":"845-534-7892","admissionsPhone":"845-534-9860","fax":"845-534-4128","email":"admissions@sks.org","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Dean of Academics Harold Heno","campusLifeSummary":"Welcome all students and parents,\n\nFor 150 years, The Storm King School has been a thriving community of scholars, athletes, and artists. Our core values of truth, respect, and responsibility bring out the very best in each of our students, both in and out of the classroom.\n\nThe Storm King School is a true boarding school - about 70 percent of our students live on campus. The residential experience at Storm King educates the whole student, both in and out of the classroom. The residence experience builds a strong community through evening and weekend activities, such as community service opportunities, arts and cultural trips, hiking and rock climbing at many others. The student activities committee keeps dorm life active with pizza study breaks, dances, concerts, and much more.\n\nLiving on campus helps our students to get to know their teachers better because most faculty members also live there. In fact, up to 20 faculty members are active in each dorm as advisers, residents, coaches - and there’s at least one faculty apartment on each floor of every dormitory.\n\nOur focus at SKS is on individual development. Our programs are designed to facilitate that development. We believe that students learn best in a supportive and safe environment, and we challenge our students every day to continue to improve. Please take a look at the exciting descriptions of the activities and opportunities available to SKS students and feel free to contact us with any questions.

1889, Thacher has prepared gifted students from all backgrounds for top colleges and lives of leadership. Thacher's blend of rigorous academics and outdoor life is distinctive and distinguished. Nearly 20 AP courses are offered. Students live by an Honor Code. In a community renowned for its warmth and unpretentiousness, a willingness to lend a hand is an everyday expectation. Forty percent of our students identify as students of color.

Extensive outdoor and horse programs and 28 competitive athletic teams are offered.","dirAdmissions":"William McMahon","phone":"805-646-4377","admissionsPhone":"805-640-3210","fax":"805-640-9377","email":"admission@thacher.org","academicSummary":"Deeply committed to the intellectual life and the development of its students, Thacher offers an academic program that is both rigorous and flexible. At its core, the program is designed to encourage the best mix of broad, general background and specialized study for each student.\n\n\nWhile our basic diploma requirements prepare our students for college-level study, all Thacher students move well beyond this minimum to pursue areas of special interest. Thacher offers a broad and rich array of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, as well as several courses beyond the AP level.\n\n\nFull engagement with a Thacher education means developing critical thinking skills and learning to communicate effectively, by listening, speaking, and writing well. In all disciplines the classroom experience is intimate—Thacher’s average class size is eleven—and largely discussion based, with students often collaborating on projects.\n\n\nStill, academic learning at Thacher isn’t confined to the four walls of a traditional classroom. Students and faculty often tackle their subjects elsewhere—exploring a creek to learn about its ecosystem, reading poetry on a grassy lawn, or trekking to the horse barns to practice hands-on veterinary medicine. Some students even choose to move beyond the bounds of the Thacher campus, spending a year studying abroad or with other programs in the U.S.","dirAcademics":"Director of Studies Blossom Pidduck","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Sabina McMahon","studentLifeSummary":"Although student life at Thacher includes all sorts of activities—academics, athletics, the arts, and extracurriculars—at the core, it is about self-discovery within a community. Students come to realize that they will learn more about themselves and the worlds they are a part of if they engage wholly in the life of the community taking place around them. The Thacher School stands for honesty, trust, and respect for others.\n\n \n\nThe special experience at Thacher is woven together from the small moments of daily living: a student and teacher puzzling over a calculus problem, a trail ride with a friend into the hills behind School, an athlete staying after practice to help a teammate perfect her jump shot, a conversation about a short story while eating chips and salsa in the dorm, a quiet moment of reflection as the sun sets over the Ojai Valley. Living a life of integrity, one filled with honesty, forthrightness, kindness, respect, courage, and determination, students will meet and exceed the high expectations the School has set for them.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":" Gregory Haggard","dirAthletics":" Fagan","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"Thacher’s approach to college placement is based on early preparation and a thoughtfully plotted introduction to the complex issues and requirements of the search and application process. Figuring out the differences between early action and early decision, learning how to write effective college essays, taking the SAT or ACT with confidence and preparation, filling out applications or applying for financial aid, deciding which schools to focus on—all these tasks require levelheadedness and a sensible and methodical approach. These qualities are precisely what our team of college counselors aims to encourage as they help students establish goals, set timelines, and understand terminology.\n\nAt Thacher, we believe that there is value in having time to process information, gain perspective, and achieve comfort with the various aspects of college admission. If students initiate this process in the junior year when there is less pressure about the final results, they can successfully establish a foundation of knowledge that will help them navigate the actual process as seniors. At that time, they can expend energy more effectively on the truly important issue: identifying the personal priorities that will contribute to a rewarding match with an appropriate college or university community.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Maria Morales-Kent","colleges":[{"name":"Colorado College","attending":15},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":14},{"name":"Dartmouth College","attending":9},{"name":"New York University","attending":9},{"name":"Occidental College","attending":9},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":9},{"name":"Claremont McKenna College","attending":8},{"name":"Columbia University","attending":7},{"name":"Duke University","attending":7},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":7},{"name":"Yale University","attending":7},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":6},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":6},{"name":"Middlebury College","attending":6},{"name":"Pomona College","attending":6},{"name":"University of Richmond","attending":6},{"name":"Williams College","attending":6},{"name":"Colby College","attending":5},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":5},{"name":"Scripps College","attending":5},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","attending":5},{"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","attending":5},{"name":"Bowdoin College","attending":4},{"name":"Brown University","attending":4},{"name":"Carleton College","attending":4},{"name":"Davidson College","attending":4},{"name":"McGill University","attending":4},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","attending":4},{"name":"University of Oregon","attending":4},{"name":"Vassar College","attending":4},{"name":"Whitman College","attending":4}],"alumni":[{"name":"Rukmini Callimachi","year":1991,"description":"After graduating from Dartmouth College and later earning her master’s at Oxford, Rukmini Callimachi began as a reporter in New Delhi, India, filing stories with Time magazine and other news organizations.

This safe and intimate setting promotes a focus on personal values and intellectual growth – creating a refuge from societal pressures and distractions.  An extensive network of extracurricular programs accord students the opportunity to try new activities and develop new passions.  A thriving outdoor program, complete with backpacking, rafting, and rock climbing encourages our students to develop leadership skills while enjoying the natural surroundings.  \n\nThe hallmark of a Webb education is our emphasis on honor and personal integrity.

For many this kind of environment was a welcome change. \"I came from big, big, public schools and the size of Webb's classes is really nice. You get a lot of individual attention and you can't really hide, which motivates you to get your work done,\" says one student.

Getting students involved in dorm life is crucial to making them feel at home. \n\nFrom nightly dinners to bowling on the weekends, activities within each dorm and between the dorms create a strong sense of community. Webb has three male and three female dormitories. Students are assigned to a dorm on the basis of their grade. Each dorm has faculty members who support students in the dorm throughout the week. The dorm common rooms have a TV and DVD player along with computers and Internet connections. All dorms feature a wireless network.\n\n\n\nWebb works to create an environment that encourages independence while providing its students with structure and support.

Activities range from professional and college level sporting events and concerts in Nashville to white water rafting and trips to area malls and movie theaters. Each dorm plans its own activities as well. The dorms will go out to dinner, watch movies, go to sporting events - the possibilities are endless.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Webb is small by design and our community allows students to thrive by fostering greater involvement and individual growth. Every student has a chance to be an athlete, an artist, or both. There are no limits to opportunity, and with international recognition for our theatre program and strong athletic play in recent state tournaments, there are no limits to success.\n\nFine Arts\n\nWebb’s expanded fine arts program provides the opportunities and facilities for creative talents to flourish. Theater, music, and the visual arts all have their place here – and they’re available to students who want to explore their creative side. In Webb's fine arts center, our students have an outstanding facility for students to pursue each of these passions.\n\nTheatre: Webb’s theatre program performs two full productions each year. Our director uses her ties from years of professional experience to recruit professional actors to lead Master Courses in drama that provide unique learning opportunities throughout the year.\n\nMusic: Webb’s choir and string ensemble perform both on and off campus during the year. Each program is led by teachers with a high level of experience. \n\nAthletics\n\nThe Webb School offers 16 Varsity Sports. These programs balance a desire to win with the responsibility of being a good team member. Webb had four teams compete at the state tournament last year, highlighted by the boys’ soccer team’s advancement to the state championship game. \n\nSports: Baseball (B), Basketball (B,G), Cross Country (B,G), Golf (B,G), Lacrosse (B,G), Soccer (B,G), Softball (G), Tennis (B,G), Trap, and Volleyball (G).","dirArts":"Mrs. Janet Linton","dirAthletics":"Mrs. Dorsett","notable":["2012 Lacrosse Division II State Champions","Middle School Boys Soccer Conference Champions","2014 MTAC Football State Champs and 2016 Co-Champs"],"collegeSummary":"About College Counseling at Webb\n\nThe College Counseling Office at The Webb School understands its primary role within the community as guiding our students toward a college that is a good fit. The College Counseling Office strives to maintain an atmosphere free from prejudice, favoritism, or predisposition in regards to what college students are investigating. Therefore, while faculty and counselors will offer insight, suggestions and, perhaps, some personal opinions gleaned from their time in college, our main goal is to help students find a place where they will find both success and happiness after leaving the Webb community.\n\nIn regards to the process itself, the Office of College Counseling realizes that the fundamental responsibility in choosing a college is up to the students. For it is the students themselves who must write the essay, sit for standardized examinations, ask for teacher and counselor recommendations, fill out the application material, and ultimately leave for college. The counseling office does, however, pledge to support our students in myriad ways to insure their highest academic, athletic, and personal potential so that they can take full advantage of their college experience. With this in mind, the counseling office remains a place for students to browse their Naviance account, look over college materials, web search particular colleges, discuss pertinent issues (be they personal or academic in nature), or simply relax in a supportive environment.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Chris Rodriguez","colleges":[{"name":"University of the South","attending":12},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","attending":8},{"name":"University of Tennessee","attending":15},{"name":"Davidson College","attending":5},{"name":"Georgetown","attending":5},{"name":"University of Alabama","attending":7},{"name":"Berry College","attending":8},{"name":"Georgia Tech","attending":6},{"name":"Penn State","attending":5},{"name":"New York University","attending":4},{"name":"Emory","attending":4},{"name":"Wake Forest","attending":3},{"name":"Hendrix College","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"Charles Alexander","year":null,"description":"International Editor for TIME Magazine"},{"name":"Fielding Lewis Wright","year":null,"description":"Governor of Mississippi"},{"name":"Lewis M.

Since our founding in 1886, we have remained true to the original focus of New England boarding schools: the development of mind, body and spirit. We develop the mind through our college preparatory curriculum and through a campus-wide ethos of inquiry and engagement in learning. We develop the body through sports and other physical activities, making full use of our spectacular natural setting. We develop the spirit through reflection, exploration of meaning and purpose, and service in the broader world.\n\n\nIn the context of a traditional liberal arts curriculum, we engage students in authentic inquiry– asking and pursuing questions that matter to them. This inquiry process not only leads to enduring learning, it helps students develop the skills and habits essential for academic success. Our students learn how to frame a question, how to find and evaluate research resources, how to synthesize information, and how to formulate an argument. They develop habits of curiosity, collaboration, and persistence. In short, they become great learners.","dirAdmissions":"Allison Letourneau","phone":"603-444-2928","admissionsPhone":"603-444-2928 ext.226","fax":"603-444-5568","email":"admissions@whitemountain.org","academicSummary":"The White Mountain School has a traditional college preparatory curriculum. However, it is the intellectual engagement and development of the student that is our ultimate focus. Every class is an opportunity to practice the skills, virtues and habits of mind necessary for success in the 21st century. Within each discipline we offer a range of courses from introductory-level to Advanced Placement, Honors, or student-designed independent studies. But whether a class is labeled as history, science, world languages or visual arts, it serves to further The White Mountain School’s focus on curiosity, critical thinking and communication.\n\nCuriosity- We work to nurture our students’ curiosity. We ask them to identify and examine phenomena that spark big questions. Our curriculum serves to guide and inspire students in discovering their passions.\n\nCritical Thinking- Because we encourage students to pose their own questions, we also teach them to identify and ask the right questions. We seek to instill an inquisitive spirit, one that challenges assumptions and dares always to ask the most important questions of all: “Why?” and “How do I know?”\n\nCommunication- The ability to communicate well, to speak and write with clarity and grace, is and will remain a skill essential for success in schools, colleges, the workplace and the civic arena. Responsible and effective communication is practiced and honed with every discipline and subject area, whether through participation in discussions, essay writing or the creation and delivery of presentations.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean Shane MacElhiney","campusLifeSummary":"Living intentionally in a small supportive community allows students to truly feel like WMS is a home away from home. Boarding students live in one of four dorms with their peers, faculty members and faculty families. Each dorm has common space with couches, a TV and a microwave. Faculty doors are very often open and their apartments can feel like an extension of the dorm. This accessibility is one of the hallmarks of what makes the WMS community special.\n\nEvening study hall provides a quiet time for students to do their homework. After study hall is often when dorm jobs are completed, rooms cleaned, and dorms may have meetings. Students may also hang out in the student lounge or use the fitness center before check-in.\nThe dining hall serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and is available for drinks and light snacks all day. Students also have the option of having a mini-refrigerator in their room for handy access to snacks.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Nate Snow","studentLifeSummary":"On weekends, faculty offer a range of activities that students can sign up for.

Jefferson School (TJ) offers an unparalleled college-preparatory curriculum in a close-knit, supportive academic community.  For nearly 70 years TJ’s liberal arts approach has been a launching pad for college and professional success.  College preparation is our speciality: all of our graduates move on to four-year colleges and universities across the nation and abroad.  Average SAT scores consistently position TJ among the world’s top boarding schools.  With a daily schedule of concise morning classes and a student teacher ratio of 7:1, students enjoy focused individual attention with faculty, advisors and staff.  Students develop their academic talents as well as their autonomy.  Most Junior students take two AP courses while Seniors take all AP coursework in their final year.  Day students share dorm space on a picturesque 20 acre campus with boarding students from 26 St. Louis area zip codes, eight states and 11 countries.  Students live and learn amidst faculty members and resident assistants in cottages throughout the grounds.  The Charles Merrill building serves as the hub of activity housing classrooms and the dining room.  Additional campus facilities offer access to athletics and the fine arts.  Five-day boarding for regional families is a popular option. Nearly 40% of TJ’s families receive financial assistance.  As a current TJ student has said “TJ is more than a school.  TJ has given me my voice.”","dirAdmissions":"Stephen Held","phone":"314-843-4151","admissionsPhone":"314-843-4151","fax":"314-843-3527","email":"admissions@tjs.org","academicSummary":"A classical education means much more than the study of Greek and Latin. Its object of study is “the best that has been thought and said.” Above all, a classical education will push and keep wide open the two doors of higher learning: numbers and words. At Thomas Jefferson (TJ), you will learn Latin, Greek, and either French or Italian; you will read through and discuss a collection of books that are at once both timeless and timely; and you will write and face scrupulous line-editing almost every day, including while on vacations. On the other hand, you will also take an accelerated math sequence that culminates in AP calculus in either the junior or senior year. AP courses in science and history will also be required and will give you a head start on college. If you think you can’t do all this or if you think you have math anxiety or no imagination in reading, have faith! Practice and guidance will prepare you for pre-law or pre-med, history or computer science. We believe that you can do it, and we will help you through the hard parts. (We don’t pretend it’s not hard; we just think it’s necessary – and completely possible.) We don’t want a previous weak and lopsided background in high school to decide which door in life you choose to open. We want you to be able to choose freely. Liberal education, after all, has as its root and end freedom – freedom of the most important kind, intellectual freedom based on a head well filled and well formed. The job market will always be looking for that, and the world will always be better off for it. Finally, a classical education involves more than just the best books and study materials. It requires the active, patient, inspiring, demanding mentorship of well-educated adults who look for the best version of you. Plato needed Socrates, Alexander the Great Aristotle, and Thoreau Emerson. It requires a community of lively, motivated peers similarly engaged in the pursuit of the best and highest things. And it requires lofty goals to keep everyone looking up and ahead.","dirAcademics":"Director of Academics Jane Roth","campusLifeSummary":"","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Amanda Corea","studentLifeSummary":"","artsAthleticsSummary":"Each student takes a fine-arts course every year from September until spring break. These classes meet twice a week on Wednesday and Friday afternoons for 60 minutes.  The fine-arts curriculum includes art- and music-history courses of various types, which give the students a basic knowledge of some major art forms and their importance in history and civilization.  It also includes studio courses, which allow students to develop their own artistic skills. There are several opportunities for student performance and exhibition throughout the year, including a show of student artwork in the Visual Arts Gallery.  Students are also required to attend performances of music and dance or visit galleries and museums depending on which course they are enrolled in.  \n\nEvery student participates every year in athletics, and the year is divided into three athletic seasons.  Seniors are exempt from athletics for one trimester (their choice).  Students can choose between team sports and individual or recreational activities.Because team sports require competition with other schools, they also require a greater time commitment with longer practices (one hour, four days per week) and afternoons devoted to scheduled games.  TJ competes in the Missouri Athletic Conference (MAC), and our competition includes other small schools in the region.  The chance to play on one or more of the varsity teams is offered to all students but forced on none. Students with special skills or interests may be permitted to pursue them off-campus in place of our offerings.","dirArts":" Karen Fairbank","dirAthletics":" Roth","notable":["2012 national YoungArts award winner","High School Collaborative Arts Program, UMSL","Girls Basketball 2012 Conference Champions"],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Karen Fairbank","colleges":[{"name":"Saint Louis University","attending":4},{"name":"Boston University","attending":3},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","attending":4},{"name":"Emory University","attending":3},{"name":"Claremont McKenna College","attending":2},{"name":"New York University","attending":3},{"name":"Northwestern University","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[{"quote":"With TJ's academic rigor comes both a sense of accomplishment and a profound love for the pursuit of knowledge.","alum":{"name":"Henry Agbo","year":2005}},{"quote":"I have come to realize that independence is a rare commodity.

Trafalgar Castle boarding is a home away from home that provides a unique and personal experience because students and teachers interact in meaningful ways both in and out of the classroom.

Being in an all-girl environment allows students to just be themselves.  But that’s just the beginning. At Trafalgar we do much more to support and encourage all students to achieve excellence in all aspects of the rich programming offered.  Beyond the academic programme, there is an extensive co-curricular life for the girls. At Trafalgar, we offer a full life outside of the classroom, knowing that, for girls, taking risks and trying new things builds resilience and self-esteem—those key characteristics that will carry them through the toughest times. Whether it’s Athletics, the Arts, active Citizenship or Peer Mentoring, we have something to offer every girl at the Castle. One new dad reports, “Within weeks of coming to Trafalgar Castle my daughter started taking risks and joining teams she had never tried before”.  That’s exactly what we want to encourage!","artsAthleticsSummary":"Trafalgar Castle School's Athletic programme is an important aspect of every student’s co-curricular experience.

Physical Education classes, House intramural competitions, physical fitness clubs and competitive sport are all venues where the students are encouraged to participate.\n\nFor the competitive sports programme, Trafalgar Castle competes with the other Independent Schools in Ontario through their membership in the Conference of Independent School’s Athletic Association (CISAA).

is located on 150 acres overlooking the Hudson River Valley, just 90 minutes north of New York City. The goal of a Trinity-Pawling education is to unlock the potential for greatness that exists in each boy.\n\nThe School pursues this goal through a vigorous learning environment that emphasizes 21st century skills such as innovation, creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking. A commitment to project-based and experiential learning acknowledges the research that has identified learning paradigms that prove to be successful for boys. A camaraderie of “brotherhood” is enhanced by the mutuality of a family of educators and students who are dedicated to building a culture of excellence and honor. The Trinity-Pawling learning experience combines a timeless commitment to character with a dedication to prepare young men for an ever-changing world.\n \nOne of the School’s most distinctive attributes is its signatory Effort System, which began 45 years ago. Each boy at Trinity-Pawling is recognized and assessed in terms of the effort he devotes to a given endeavor: academics, athletics, dormitory responsibilities, civic engagement, attendance, and extracurricular programs. The learning objective inherent in this ethos of effort is to teach young people that the more they invest of themselves the greater their achievements will be. The Effort System, then, becomes a pervasive characteristic of a boy’s experience at Trinity-Pawling.\n \nTrinity-Pawling offers over 100 academic courses and 18 AP courses, interscholastic competition in 13 sports within the highly competitive New England Founders League, and a myriad of extracurricular activities.","dirAdmissions":"JP Burlington","phone":"845-855-3100","admissionsPhone":"845-855-4825","fax":"845-855-4827","email":"admissions@trinitypawling.org","academicSummary":"Trinity-Pawling's academic program is both broad and deep offering boys the opportunity to realize their fullest possible potential in a wide range of disciplines from studio art through labratory science, technology through Mandarin Chinese.  We offer 18 Advanced Placement courses in all major disciplines.  Individual classes are geared toward the particular needs of the students enrolled.  We offer honors and advanced sections for those seeking maximum challenge and skills-based classes for those seeking to solidify their foundation in a given discipline. Trinity-Pawling also offers an exceptional program for boys with language-based learning issues.  A course of study consisting of three classes delivered over two years under the aegis of the English Department, the \"Language Program\" is designed to give bright dyslexic boys the tools they need to be credible applicants at the most selective colleges and universities in the country.  The school employs two college counselors to guide seniors through the process of identifying, making application to and enrolling in college.  T-P graduates matriculate at a wide range of schools from large state universities to small liberal arts colleges.  In any given year, T-P will send approximately 5% of its senior class to Ivy League schools.","dirAcademics":"Academic Dean/Assoc. Head David Coratti","campusLifeSummary":"Trinity-Pawling was founded as a boarding school and remains true to that tradition. Of our present enrollment of 300 boys, 80% are boarding students. They are housed in eighteen distinct dormitory units in eight separate buildings. Individual dormitory units contain as few as eight students and as many as sixteen. Generally the larger units tend to have two adults serving as dormitory masters, while the smaller units may have only one adult serving as a dormitory master. In all circumstances, the adults are assisted in their duties by seniors in good standing who serve as dormitory proctors. Ultimately, the dormitory is where our boys truly “live.” In turn, the quality of the people who run these dormitories is of paramount importance. 32 teachers live in dormitories, 10 additional teachers live on campus as a condition of their employment. The residential staff is the academic staff. Trinity-Pawling does not believe in the practice of having a separate staff of residential adult advisors. Those administrators no longer on dormitory play an active role in the functioning of the dormitories, and continue to serve as advisors. The school mission statement states that Trinity Pawling School intends “to foster a sense of community based upon a boarding school tradition – boys living with peers and faculty families.” This intention is best met by organizing our dorms according to class groupings. Each dormitory unit is comprised of students from a particular class. Dormitory parents and the senior proctors then oversee them. The school’s intention is to try to keep students of the same class in the same region on campus. For example, we have “freshmen corner” on our quad. This grouping fosters a sense of “home” and belonging for our newest students. The dormitory masters also serve as advisors for the majority of the boys on their dormitory. This ensures the age appropriateness of student interaction as well as allowing the faculty to deal with boys of a similar age on a regular basis.\n\nTrinity-Pawling truly prides itself on those aspects of residential life that lead to an environment of home like adult support for the residents. Consequently, dormitory masters are the first adults in any line of communication at the school. Faculty members are encouraged to maintain an “open door policy” during study hall. This facilitates both supervision, as well as a sense","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Residential Life Dutch Keel","studentLifeSummary":"Life at Trinity-Pawling revolves around the dormitories.  Some 80% of the boys live in doubles, the balance in single rooms.  All rooms are wired for internet access with each boy having access to a data drop.  Internet access is provided for acadmic and communication purposes.  Boys usage of the net is carefully monitored and limited to reasonable hours.  Common rooms in the dormitories offer comfortable spaces for boys to gather in groups to talk, play games and watch TV.  Dorm parents monitor the boys' progress in all phases of life on campus--academic, athletic and social.  Dorm faculty form one of the primary points of contact for parents as they assess how well their sons are acclimating to life at school.  Trinity-Pawling attempts to the greatest degree possible to house boys by grade.  Each dorm, however, is lead by proctors from either the senior or junior class whose job it is to help boys on their floor negotiate life at school productively and comfortably.  The Student Senate provides a forum where boys from each dorm can discuss issues arising out of life at school and through which students can make recommendations for making life on campus better for all.","artsAthleticsSummary":"Athletics forms a large component of life on campus at Trinity-Pawling.  All boys participate in athletics in each season, either on a competitive or recreational basis.  T-P fields teams in 13 sports:  cross-country running, football, soccer, basketball, ice hockey, squash, wrestling, skiing, baseball, track, tennis, golf and lacrosse.  There are some forty teams, however, that play interscholastic games in these sports.  Thus, every boy can find a team to which he can make a contribution, whether he's the next Wayne Gretzky or he's just learning how to skate.  T-P believes that interscholastic athletic competition fosters discipline, responsibility, selflessness and pride.  Further, athletics foster physical well-being and an understanding of the long term benefits of healthy living.\n\nThe arts are also crucial to life on campus.  T-P has truly fine offerings in both the fine and performing arenas.  Housed in a $14 million complex, the program boasts the daily participation of over 180 boys on campus.  We offer fine arts classes for beginners as well as instruction for already talented artists.  Major mediums are pursued: painting, drawing, watercolor, sculpture, ceramics, and photography.  As for performing arts, the school has a truly fine drama program.  The Trinity-Pawling Drama Society stages two straight stage plays and one full scale musical annually.  In addition, the Middle Schoolers write, cast, stage and produce their own musical.  One of the best features of the drama program is that it is coed with young women from the local community filling the female roles.  \nMusic is also alive and well at the school.  T-P boasts an impressive choir that has performed on stage at Lincoln Center.  The school's a cappella singing group--The Trinitones--is recognized for its excellence among peer institutions in the region.  We also offer a jazz band and a string ensemble for those interested in instrumental music.","dirArts":"Art Department Head Ned Reade","dirAthletics":"Art Department Head Foster","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The college placement office excels at finding the right college for our students.  The US alone has 2500 colleges. The class of 2015 submitted 1209 applications to 363 different colleges and universities and the 100 plus students are matriculating to 85 different institutions in the United States and Canada. The process starts in 9th grade when a student's schedule is fixed to maximize his transcript's strength for colleges matched against that student's ability. Through the four years a student should be well positioned to be a strong candidate at schools well matched for him. Trinity-Pawling hosts the PSAT, ACT, SAT and TOEFL standardized tests. Each year approximately 150 colleges visit our students on the Trinity-Pawling campus and make presentations. During junior year, the college counselors work closely with each student and his parents creating an individualized list of prospective colleges and map out an individual plan. Over the summer, rising seniors are encouraged to visit schools, start work on their essays and focus on whittling down the prospective list to an active list. Applications are started in August and by the first week of school, the process is well underway! Trinity-Pawling uses Naviance (a wonderful facilitating compute program) which allows all applications to be submitted and tracked electronically. The process is quicker and for today's generation, extremely \"user friendly.\" Most of our students utilize Early Decision and/or Early Action plans so the college process for many seniors ends by winter break. Those students who plan to play collegiate athletics work closely with our coaches and college staff to assist with establishing contacts between coaches and the students and meeting all NCAA requirements. The college process requires close monitoring of deadlines. Although the college process is long and daunting, the college office makes it worthwhile with positive results.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Slade Mead","colleges":[{"name":"George

in 1829, Upper Canada College enjoys a reputation as one of North America’s great independent schools. UCC alumni include renowned politicians, scholars, business leaders, artists and Olympians. UCC’s main campus is in the heart of Toronto, a beautiful, safe city that proudly promotes itself as one of the world’s most ethnically diverse. The school comprises 1,160 students in Senior Kindergarten through Grade 12 (IB2) with Boarding from Grade 8. Our campus blends heritage architecture with unsurpassed facilities, including a double-pad hockey arena, two large libraries, modern science and technology labs and the Norval Outdoor School, UCC’s 400-acre nature sanctuary, located rurally 50 kilometres northwest of Toronto. UCC is committed to offering “big school” opportunities and facilities combined with a “small school” approach to individualized learning. UCC blends the best of its long-standing traditions with the best of innovation in education and society. Within our diverse community of learners, we help individual personalities develop their unique passions, be it history, jazz or sports. Students have opportunities to develop personal strengths through both international service trips and local community initiatives. Our graduates receive both the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the Ontario Secondary School Diploma.","dirAdmissions":"David McBride","phone":"416-4881125","admissionsPhone":"416-488-1125 ext.2220","fax":"416-484-8618","email":"admission@ucc.on.ca","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":"Dr. Julia Kinnear","campusLifeSummary":"UCC is located on 16 hectares in the heart of Toronto, one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Our school boasts a number of athletic and creative facilities, including the Norval Outdoor School, a dual pad arena complex, theatres and athletic training centre.\n\nOur graduates receive the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the Ontario Secondary School Diploma.  \n\nUCC's IB program is one of Canada's broadest with scores almost 10% higher than the world average. Our grads are highly regarded by post-secondary institutions worldwide.  The UCC global network of 8,000 alumni includes leaders and innovators in politics, finance, arts, athletics, media and beyond.\n\nUCC seeks to admit well-rounded individuals who stand out from the crowd through academic performance, involvement in extra-curricular activities and a natural aptitude for the arts, athletics, etc.  In other words, we want (and attract) the best boys from across North America and around the world.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Andrew Turner","studentLifeSummary":"We know choosing the right residential program requires much research and deliberation. The goal is to find a place where you can learn and live in a supportive academic community and we're here to assist every step of the way.  \n\nWe are committed to providing students with a safe and rewarding experience. As expected, many students required assistance as they adjust.  Our Residential House Advisers are sensitive to new students' needs as they make this transition.  With a staff ratio of 1:5, advisers and faculty provide the direction and encouragement students need to achieve their goals and dreams.  Our two residences are home to actors, athletes, musicians, debaters and scholars from across North America and around the globe.\n\nWithin a five minute walk, boarders have access to our convenient public transit system. We're fortunate to be nestled in the heart of Toronto.

Our weekend program offers a variety of cultural, educational and recreational programs. Opportunities include bike tours, rock climbing, a winter ski program, movies, museums, theatre and sporting events.

We strive to work in close partnership with boys and their parents, recognizing, as psychologist Michael Thompson has pointed out, that this process is about much more than the mechanics of selecting a place of higher education: it is “the most important and difficult transition” in a young person’s life. As such, the primary goal is to encourage our young men to develop a useful template for making wise adult decisions, one which recognizes the value of thorough research, honest reflection, and a willingness to follow one’s own path.\n\nWith 100% university placement and IB scores 8-9 per cent above the average, our grads are well-equipped to head on to top universities in Canada, the U.S. and internationally. A sampling of recent destinations have included Canadian destinations such as the University of Toronto, Western University, Queen’s University and McGill University. In the U.S. grads have gone off to the Jullliard School, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University and Stanford University. International destinations are the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of Oxford and the Royal College of Surgeons.","dirCollege":"Director of University Counselling Katherine Ridout","colleges":[{"name":"Queen's University, Canada","attending":18},{"name":"University of Toronto, Canada","attending":21},{"name":"University of Western, Canada","attending":27},{"name":"McGill, Canada","attending":14},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":3},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":2},{"name":"Yale University","attending":2},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","attending":2},{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","attending":1},{"name":"Columbia University","attending":2}],"alumni":[{"name":"Brendan Fraser","year":1987,"description":"actor"},{"name":"Ernest McCulloch","year":1943,"description":"stem cell pioneer"},{"name":"Michael Ignatieff","year":35285,"description":"Liberal Party leader"},{"name":"Barney Williams","year":null,"description":"Olympic rower"},{"name":"J.

Villanova’s Catholic, Augustinian mission sets us apart from many boarding programs with our emphasis on Christian principles, Gospel values, and our Augustinian core values: love, truth, and unity. Resident students learn how to make ethical/moral decisions, think critically, and all in a loving, supporting environment that feels more like a family than a dormitory.  Like any family, the members sometimes have conflict, make mistakes, or need help.   Villanova teaches boarders how to resolve conflicts, the value of forgiveness, how to be self-advocates and where to find answers.\n\nVillanova's loving family environment offers a place for students to share triumphs and heartaches together, develop friendships with individuals from all over the world, many of whom visit each other during school breaks and stay in contact well beyond high school.

VES’ mission remains true to when the school was founded more than a century ago – to know students individually and help each grow Toward Full Stature. \n\nIntentionally small, with 260 students from all over the country and the world, VES is just the right size and offers the right blend of programming and community to develop well-rounded students – scholars, athletes, arts enthusiasts and confident, globally aware leaders. \n\nAt the heart of the school is delivering an exceptional VES experience – one that offers the best teachers, innovative programs and a vibrant learning environment for our students. Our Student Life and College Counseling programs are among the top as we focus on ensuring happy, healthy, well-adjusted students ready to go out and conquer the world.\n\nVES graduates attend many of the world’s finest colleges and universities, including Stanford, UVA, Cornell, Emory, Yale, Columbia University, MIT, Wellesley, the U.S. Naval Academy, Georgetown, UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, the College of William & Mary, and Wake Forest. \n\nSet on 160 acres in Lynchburg, Virginia, at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, we take advantage of our spectacular location. We are minutes from a thriving downtown with music, arts, maker spaces, a trail system and great restaurants. And we are within a three hour drive to Washington, DC, two hours to Richmond, Va., and just an hour to Charlottesville and Lexington, VA and Greensboro and Winston-Salem, NC.","dirAdmissions":"Justine Button","phone":"434-385-3600","admissionsPhone":"434-385-3607","fax":"434-385-3603","email":"admissions@ves.org","academicSummary":"","dirAcademics":" Sarah Cuccio","campusLifeSummary":"The VES athletic program offers students a chance to play the sport of their choice regardless of skill levels. Our coaches are highly trained, committed to their players, and most of them are classroom teachers. Each one shares a love of working with students, a passion for coaching, and a dedication to developing and nurturing every player’s talent. \n\nWe train hard. We play hard. We value teamwork, sportsmanship, our unique team traditions, and the fierce challenge of a long standing rivalry. We are as proud of our junior varsity players who work up to varsity as we are of our varsity players who go on to play in college. We celebrate the shot putter who sets a new state record as well as swimmers in their first race. Whether it is a state championship or a personal best, we compete with skill, integrity, and the VES spirit.","dirCampusLife":" Chris Button","studentLifeSummary":"Campus life encompasses more than classrooms and playing fields. When class is over, faculty and students spend time together participating in a sport, a community service project, the arts, or a myriad of other offerings that will allow them to pursue a particular interest or passion. On the weekends, trips are regularly planned to ski resorts, paintball courses, the mall, and movie theatres. School dances are routine. But our school’s small size makes impromptu activities possible too. One teacher might make a late-night run to the local diner for Cheezy Westerns. Another, thinking the students need to see more classic films, shows Charlie Chaplin on a Sunday afternoon. A circus arrives across the street and the Headmaster walks over with a group of students for the show. \n\nEqually exciting is our informal campus life which does not fit so easily on a brochure: those student-initiated gatherings are perhaps the greatest emblems of our students’ happiness. It is these moments that transform the school from something other than just a place of learning. The baseball field becomes an arena for Frisbee, a dorm room becomes a pizzeria on Friday night, or a snowfall offers spontaneous creativity. Some lazy Saturday in December, on a lark and with a pair of scissors, a student takes greenery from the hedges outside his dorm and literally decks its halls with boughs of holly. Our school is always in a state of metamorphosis: life-changing.","artsAthleticsSummary":"There are opportunities for every student to participate in the fine arts at VES. Those who enjoy music join Glee Club, Vocal Ensemble, or Instrumental Ensemble, or take classes in music history and theory. Interested in drama? Participate in the fall play or spring musical, and learn about the technical and performance aspects of theater. Artists of all mediums can study the masters in art history or find an outlet in our studio art classes, and display their creations in the school gallery and hallways. Students with a real passion for the fine arts may take their talents overseas to Spoleto, Italy, and participate in the Spoleto Study Abroad Program, a month-long intensive fine arts workshop. \n\nAt VES, discovering, nurturing, and showcasing student talent is paramount. Studio and performing artists on campus are featured at all major campus events. Studio artists enter local and regional art competitions, and performing artists perform on campus as well as regionally, and even internationally, when possible. The musical performance groups include Glee Club, Vocal Ensemble, and Instrumental Ensemble. The Drama department produces a fall play and a spring musical each year.\n\nDiscover…Develop…Debut…find your place in the arts at VES.","dirArts":" Debbie Burton","dirAthletics":" Leake","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Mimi Csatlos","colleges":[{"name":"University of Virginia","attending":14},{"name":"Hampden Sydney","attending":8},{"name":"University of Mississippi","attending":7},{"name":"Sewanee-University of the South","attending":6},{"name":"College of Charleston","attending":5},{"name":"University of Mary Washington","attending":5},{"name":"UNC-Chapel Hill","attending":4},{"name":"William & Mary","attending":4}],"alumni":[{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""},{"name":"","year":null,"description":""}],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"","dirSummer":"","summerPrograms":[],"meritDescription":"","gallery":[{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo1.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo1.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Commencement 2016"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo2.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo2.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Faculty member Chad Hanning teaching a science class"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo3.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo3.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Many of our students participate in the musical"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo4.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo4.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"The 2016 State Championship Lacrosse Team"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo5.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo5.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Students enjoy hanging out on Box Plaza"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo6.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo6.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"The community participated in a Color Run on campus"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo7.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo7.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"Our robotics team won the 2016 state championship"},{"full":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo8.jpg___Selected.jpg","thumb":"http://www.boardingschools.com/resources/images/schoolimages/1039/images/Photo8.jpg_Thumbnail1.jpg","title":"The Virginia Episcopal School Campus"}],"events":[{"name":"Day Student Open House","type":"Open House","start":"2017-10-09T08:30:00.000Z","end":"2017-10-09T13:30:00.000Z","location":"Virginia Episcopal School","description":"Whether you come for an overnight visit or stay just for a few hours, the very best way to get to know a school is to spend time on campus.

Collectively, the Class Deans provide counsel to struggling students, settle minor disciplinary issues, and plan class-wide social events and activities throughout the year.","dirCampusLife":"Dean of Students Wendy Skinner","studentLifeSummary":"Students—boarding and day alike—are active and engaged throughout the day, as they move from classes in the morning, to athletic practices in the afternoon, to study hours and meetings with teachers in the evening.

At WRA, we care for each other.","artsAthleticsSummary":"The arts provide students with the chance to develop their creative and imaginative faculties, study the beauty of the physical world and explore new avenues of self expression.

Each season, additional offerings such as weight lifting, yoga and tai chi activities add further possibilities to consider.","dirArts":"Director of Fine Arts and Social Mission Alan Doe","dirAthletics":"Director of Fine Arts and Social Mission Haller '85","notable":["","",""],"collegeSummary":"The College Counseling Office believes that the process of applying for college should be one of positive self-discovery. Done right, it fully engages students, parents and counselors.  We help students assess their individual abilities, talents, interests and aspirations, and then we provide the knowledge, guidance and support for students to identify and seek admission to appropriate colleges and universities. Our aim is to enhance students’ chances for admission to the college or university of their choice. It is also important for them to consider carefully a range of “good matches,” creating the best possibility not only for acceptance, but also for success once enrolled.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Gunnar Olson","colleges":[{"name":"The Ohio State University","attending":28},{"name":"Denison University","attending":16},{"name":"Miami University, Oxford OH","attending":14},{"name":"New York University","attending":14},{"name":"The College of Wooster","attending":8},{"name":"University of Michigan","attending":9},{"name":"Rhodes College","attending":4},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","attending":4},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","attending":9},{"name":"United States Naval Academy","attending":8},{"name":"Northwestern University","attending":4},{"name":"The George Washington Univesity","attending":10},{"name":"Hobart and William Smith College","attending":5},{"name":"Cornell University","attending":10},{"name":"Kenyon College","attending":4},{"name":"Boston College","attending":5},{"name":"Boston University","attending":8},{"name":"Emory University","attending":9},{"name":"University of Southern California","attending":8},{"name":"Ohio Wesleyan University","attending":7},{"name":"University of Colorado at Boulder","attending":7},{"name":"American University","attending":7},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","attending":6},{"name":"Tufts University","attending":6},{"name":"Wesleyan University","attending":6},{"name":"The University of Akron","attending":5},{"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","attending":5},{"name":"Colgate University","attending":5},{"name":"Drexel University","attending":5},{"name":"Pennsylvania State University","attending":5},{"name":"University of Richmond","attending":5},{"name":"Roanoke College","attending":5},{"name":"Indiana University at Bloomington","attending":4},{"name":"John Carroll University","attending":4},{"name":"Kent State University","attending":4},{"name":"Purdue University","attending":4},{"name":"University of Chicago","attending":4},{"name":"Hamilton College-NY","attending":4},{"name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","attending":4},{"name":"Syracuse University","attending":4},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":4},{"name":"University of Vermont","attending":4},{"name":"Stanford University","attending":4},{"name":"Elon University","attending":4},{"name":"Furman University","attending":4},{"name":"High Point University","attending":4},{"name":"Virginia Tech","attending":4},{"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","attending":6}],"alumni":[],"alumniQuotes":[],"summerSummary":"We are excited to offer a variety of opportunities for students of all ages.

Some nights there are corridor meetings where dorm parents and proctors meet with the girls on their corridor to plan dorm activities, talk about improving living conditions, or celebrating a girl's birthday. Working together to live happily in this community is always a priority.","dirCampusLife":"Director of Residential Life Veronica McMahon","studentLifeSummary":"On Friday nights, girls can watch television with their dorm parent, take a shuttle to a nearby mall, visit with a teacher who lives on campus, or just hang out with friends. Sometimes there are cultural programs on campus such as a musical performer, an artistic presentation, or another form of entertainment.\n\nOn Saturday, after art classes and athletic games, students can attend social events held at Westover or other area schools, including boys' schools and co-ed schools. The social events offered include dances, movie nights, and club or class sponsored activities such as the Senior Carnival and Westover's COLORES Festival.\n\nFaculty and students alike all look forward to Sunday brunch; it is truly a spectacular treat. While most students spend Sundays relaxing, studying and preparing for the school week, there are often day trips to amusement parks and shopping plazas offered.","artsAthleticsSummary":"","dirArts":"Head of Arts Department Bob Havery","dirAthletics":"Director of Athletics Mulligan","notable":[null,null,null],"collegeSummary":"The goal of Westover's College Counseling Office is to help all of our girls matriculate at colleges where they will thrive and from which they will emerge prepared to be leaders and agents of change in the world. While students and parents are encouraged to work with the College Office at any time during their years at Westover, we begin the process with several events in the sophomore year. In the junior year we gain intensity as we gather for an eight-week college seminar that is followed by individual meetings. As we continue our journey to find schools that “fit” our students best, we strive to provide individual assistance and to build relationships with students and families.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling Cornelia \"Corky\" Beaulieu","colleges":[{"name":"University of Vermont","attending":5},{"name":"UCONN","attending":4},{"name":"George Washington Universtiy","attending":4},{"name":"Ithaca College","attending":4},{"name":"Fordham University","attending":4},{"name":"Cornell","attending":3},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":3},{"name":"Boston College","attending":3},{"name":"St. Lawrence","attending":3},{"name":"University of Michigan","attending":3},{"name":"Wellesley","attending":3},{"name":"William and Mary","attending":3},{"name":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"Katherine Woodruff Flanning","year":1945,"description":"Editor of The Christian Science Monitor from 1983-1988 and Editor and Publisher of The Anchorage Daily News from 1971-1983"},{"name":"Deborah Massey","year":1968,"description":"Member of the LPGA Golf tour from 1977-1995, LPGA Rookie of the Year in 1977, and two time winner of the Women's British Open Golf Tournament"},{"name":"Dena Simmons","year":54001,"description":"Associate Director of School Initiatives at Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, TED talker, educator, and activist"},{"name":"Ginevra King Pirie","year":null,"description":"Chicago socialite who was F.

That said, Westtown students gain admission to outstanding colleges and universities ranging from the nation’s most selective colleges to public universities to professional programs in the fine and performing arts. The college counseling staff recognizes each student as an individual and works with the student and his/her family to identify a range of options and facilitate the application process.

We feel privileged to be able to share this journey with our students and families and encourage your participation and feedback throughout the process.","dirCollege":"Director of College Counseling John Boozang","colleges":[{"name":"American University","attending":5},{"name":"Amherst College","attending":2},{"name":"Harvard University","attending":1},{"name":"University of Notre Dame","attending":2},{"name":"Columbia","attending":1},{"name":"Brown University","attending":1},{"name":"Cornell","attending":1},{"name":"Duke","attending":1},{"name":"Georgetown University","attending":1},{"name":"Haverford","attending":1},{"name":"NYU Abu Dhabi","attending":1},{"name":"UCLA","attending":5},{"name":"UC Berkeley","attending":1},{"name":"University of Michigan","attending":3},{"name":"University of Chicago","attending":1},{"name":"University of Notre Dame","attending":2},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","attending":1},{"name":"Vassar College","attending":2},{"name":"Wellesley College","attending":1},{"name":"Wesleyan University","attending":2},{"name":"Babson College","attending":7},{"name":"Boston College","attending":4},{"name":"Boston University","attending":13},{"name":"Brandeis University","attending":3},{"name":"Connecticut College","attending":6},{"name":"Emory","attending":7},{"name":"Northeastern University","attending":7},{"name":"University of Kentucky","attending":2},{"name":"Trinity College","attending":4},{"name":"Tufts","attending":3},{"name":"Pepperdine University","attending":3}],"alumni":[{"name":"Mark Shenkman","year":null,"description":"Director of Shenkman Capitol Management"},{"name":"Nitya Pibulsonggram","year":null,"description":"Thai Foreign Minister, Former Thai Ambassador to the United Nations"},{"name":"Bill James","year":null,"description":"Rockport Capitol Partners"},{"name":"Bill Guerin","year":null,"description":"NHL Hockey Player"},{"name":"Bob Lappin","year":null,"description":"Conductor, Palm Beach Orchestra"},{"name":"Galway Kinnel","year":null,"description":"Author/Poet"},{"name":"Olaf Halvorrsen","year":null,"description":"Received Royal Norwegian Order of Merit"},{"name":"Hyun Kim","year":null,"description":"Former Ambassador for the UN and Chief Legal Counsel for Samsung"},{"name":"Joey Santiago","year":null,"description":"Lead Guitarist for the Pixies"}],"alumniQuotes":[{"quote":"“WMA prepared me for college more than I have ever expected or imagined.”","alum":{"name":"n/a","year":null}},{"quote":"“The WMA network has served me better professionally than my undergrad institution... and thatís pretty tough competition for a school of under 500.”","alum":{"name":"n/a","year":null}}],"summerSummary":"Enjoy summer learning at Wilbraham & Monson Academy (WMA) with experienced faculty and join students from around the world to make new friends.\n\nWMA is an independent coeducational college preparatory school founded in 1804.The beautiful New England style 300-acre campus is located in Wilbraham, Mass., a short drive from Boston, Mass. , New York City and Providence, R.I.

is a suburban school in a small, historic city - Kingston. The student population of 477 is diverse and Sem boasts representation from 20 states and 18 countries. Two-thirds of our faculty live on campus. Nearly all students participate in at least one varsity sport, although athletic participation is not mandatory each season. Sem offers a broad range of extracurricular clubs and activities, and the community service program is part of our graduation requirements. Extensive opportunities are available in performing and fine arts. Sem offers more than 160 courses (including 22 AP), an average class size of 14, challenging electives, and a student/teacher ratio of 8:1. Graduates are accepted to highly competitive colleges and to a range of fine art and music programs.  \n\nRecent campus upgrades include a new double-turf field stadium with lights, new dormitory furniture, an additional wrestling room, a dedicated STEM lab, improved WiFi and a $16.3 million Kirby Center for Creative Arts that includes a new theater, dance studio, an art gallery and numerous rehearsal spaces. \n\nRecent athletic accomplishments include the 2014 Prep National Championship in Wrestling and three subsequent national runner-up finishes, 2017 girls lacrosse PIAA District Two Champions, and the addition of a pilot girls wrestling program and a new varsity crew team.\n\nSem also offers an opportunity for students in grades 8, 9 and 10 not currently enrolled to take part in the Sem Scholarship Program, which awards one full and several half-merit scholarships for both day and boarding students.\n\nWe invite you to discover more about Sem and see why so many of our students and alumni have found their experience here has prepared them for success now and in the future. \n\n\"Within an exponentially changing world, Wyoming Seminary dares to teach our students to honor and strive for the true, the beautiful, and the good.\" -Wyoming Seminary Mission Statement.","dirAdmissions":"Julie Bean","phone":"570-270-2160","admissionsPhone":"570-270-2160","fax":"570-270-2191","email":"admission@wyomingseminary.org","academicSummary":"The Academic Program at Sem is a comprehensive and rigorous course of study that is designed to prepare students for academic success in college while exposing them to a broad based liberal arts education.
